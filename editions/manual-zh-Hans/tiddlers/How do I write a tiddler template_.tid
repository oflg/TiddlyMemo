title: How do I write a tiddler template?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki



Fishing uses the `$:/temp/fishing` tiddler to store temporary data while it is running. When reviewing, the text content (text) and format (type) of this tiddler is cleared for each marking. So you can take the temporary data to be used in the tiddler template and store it in text in the format of json data.
