title: Fishing plugin
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Fishing plugin integrates [[Active Recall|https://docs.ankiweb.net/background.html#active-recall-testing]] and [[Spaced Repetition|https://docs.ankiweb.net/background.html#spaced-repetition]] into [[TiddlyMemo|https://tiddlymemo.org/]] using [[FSRS|https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler]] algorithm.

Incremental learning mainly uses ''Flashcards''. There are two simple principles behind Flashcards: [[Spaced Repetition|https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition]] and [[Active Recall|https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Active_recall]]. The vast majority of people have been through many 'reviews and exams', but rarely realize that these two principles are used.

Fishing plugin uses ''tiddler note'' as Flashcards for incremental learning. Since Tiddler means small fish in the Story River of TiddlyWiki, this plugin that hooks Tiddler into the Sea of Brain is called Fishing.
