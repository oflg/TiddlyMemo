Because ~TiddlyWiki is of British origin, its English documentation uses [[British spelling in preference to US spelling|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences]].

Words like <<.word customise>> are spelled <<.word -ise>>, not <<.word -ize>>. Words like <<.word colour>> will also be spelled using UK English unless they are being used for reserved words in code, such as in CSS or JavaScript.

Standard technical acronyms are written in upper case, without dots: <<.word HTML>>, not <<.word html>> or <<.word H.T.M.L.>>

Avoid arbitrarily abbreviating words and sentences. But the following abbreviations are acceptable:

|!Abbreviation |!Meaning |!Notes |
|e.g. |for example |with a dot after each letter |
|i.e. |that is to say |with a dot after each letter |
|etc |and so on |without a dot |
