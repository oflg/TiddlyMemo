M. C. A. halls to which the youth of the hills could descend for recreation.

I chafed at first, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually began to find a grim satisfaction in the life. During the early part of my stay I had been struck by the contrast between the vitality of the climate and the deadness of the community. Day by day, after the December snows were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light and air on the white landscape, which gave them back in an intenser glitter. One would have supposed that such an atmosphere must quicken the emotions as well as the blood; but it seemed to produce no change except that of retarding still more the sluggish pulse of Starkfield. When I had been there a little longer, and had seen this phase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold; when the storms of February had pitched their white tents about the devoted village and the wild cavalry of March winds had charged down to their support; I began to understand why Starkfield emerged from its six months' siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter. Twenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer, and the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the beleaguered villages; and, considering these things, I felt the sinister force of Harmon's phrase: “Most of the smart ones get away.” But if that were the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the flight of a man like Ethan Frome?</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000056\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000056\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>During my stay at Starkfield I lodged with a middle-aged widow colloquially known as Mrs. Ned Hale. Mrs. Hale's father had been the village lawyer of the previous generation, and “lawyer Varnum's house,” where my landlady still lived with her mother, was the most considerable mansion in the village. It stood at one end of the main street, its classic portico and small-paned windows looking down a flagged path between Norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the Congregational church. It was clear that the Varnum fortunes were at the ebb, but the two women did what they could to preserve a decent dignity; and Mrs. Hale, in particular, had a certain wan refinement not out of keeping with her pale old-fashioned house.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000057\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000057\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the “best parlour,” with its black horse-hair and mahogany weakly illuminated by a gurgling Carcel lamp, I listened every evening to another and more delicately shaded version of the Starkfield chronicle.

I had often walked that way on Sundays, and knew that the solitary roof showing through bare branches near the bottom of the hill was that of Frome's saw-mill. It looked exanimate enough, with its idle wheel looming above the black stream dashed with yellow-white spume, and its cluster of sheds sagging under their white load. Frome did not even turn his head as we drove by, and still in silence we began to mount the next slope. About a mile farther, on a road I had never travelled, we came to an orchard of starved apple-trees writhing over a hillside among outcroppings of slate that nuzzled up through the snow like animals pushing out their noses to breathe.

Whether because of its symbolic sense, the image it presents of a life linked with the soil, and enclosing in itself the chief sources of warmth and nourishment, or whether merely because of the consolatory thought that it enables the dwellers in that harsh climate to get to their morning's work without facing the weather, it is certain that the “L” rather than the house itself seems to be the centre, the actual hearth-stone of the New England farm.

The effect produced on Frome was rather of a complete absence of atmosphere, as though nothing less tenuous than ether intervened between the white earth under his feet and the metallic dome overhead. “It's like being in an exhausted receiver,” he thought. Four or five years earlier he had taken a year's course at a technological college at Worcester, and dabbled in the laboratory with a friendly professor of physics; and the images supplied by that experience still cropped up, at unexpected moments, through the totally different associations of thought in which he had since been living. His father's death, and the misfortunes following it, had put a premature end to Ethan's studies; but though they had not gone far enough to be of much practical use they had fed his fancy and made him aware of huge cloudy meanings behind the daily face of things.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000110\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000110\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>As he strode along through the snow the sense of such meanings glowed in his brain and mingled with the bodily flush produced by his sharp tramp.

The pitch of the Corbury road, below lawyer Varnum's spruces, was the favourite coasting-ground of Starkfield, and on clear evenings the church corner rang till late with the shouts of the coasters; but to-night not a sled darkened the whiteness of the long declivity.

The metal reflectors of the gas-jets sent crude waves of light against the whitewashed walls, and the iron flanks of the stove at the end of the hall looked as though they were heaving with volcanic fires. The floor was thronged with girls and young men. Down the side wall facing the window stood a row of kitchen chairs from which the older women had just risen. By this time the music had stopped, and the musicians—a fiddler, and the young lady who played the harmonium on Sundays—were hastily refreshing themselves at one corner of the supper-table which aligned its devastated pie-dishes and ice-cream saucers on the platform at the end of the hall. The guests were preparing to leave, and the tide had already set toward the passage where coats and wraps were hung, when a young man with a sprightly foot and a shock of black hair shot into the middle of the floor and clapped his hands. The signal took instant effect. The musicians hurried to their instruments, the dancers—some already half-muffled for departure—fell into line down each side of the room, the older spectators slipped back to their chairs, and the lively young man, after diving about here and there in the throng, drew forth a girl who had already wound a cherry-coloured “fascinator” about her head, and, leading her up to the end of the floor, whirled her down its length to the bounding tune of a Virginia reel.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000113\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000113\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Frome's heart was beating fast. He had been straining for a glimpse of the dark head under the cherry-coloured scarf and it vexed him that another eye should have been quicker than his. The leader of the reel, who looked as if he had Irish blood in his veins, danced well, and his partner caught his fire. As she passed down the line, her light figure swinging from hand to hand in circles of increasing swiftness, the scarf flew off her head and stood out behind her shoulders, and Frome, at each turn, caught sight of her laughing panting lips, the cloud of dark hair about her forehead, and the dark eyes which seemed the only fixed points in a maze of flying lines.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000114\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000114\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The dancers were going faster and faster, and the musicians, to keep up with them, belaboured their instruments like jockeys lashing their mounts on the home-stretch; yet it seemed to the young man at the window that the reel would never end. Now and then he turned his eyes from the girl's face to that of her partner, which, in the exhilaration of the dance, had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership. Denis Eady was the son of Michael Eady, the ambitious Irish grocer, whose suppleness and effrontery had given Starkfield its first notion of “smart” business methods, and whose new brick store testified to the success of the attempt. His son seemed likely to follow in his steps, and was meanwhile applying the same arts to the conquest of the Starkfield maidenhood. Hitherto Ethan Frome had been content to think him a mean fellow; but now he positively invited a horse-whipping.

Mattie Silver came from Stamford, and when she entered the Fromes' household to act as her cousin Zeena's aid it was thought best, as she came without pay, not to let her feel too sharp a contrast between the life she had left and the isolation of a Starkfield farm.

He had taken to the girl from the first day, when he had driven over to the Flats to meet her, and she had smiled and waved to him from the train, crying out, “You must be Ethan!” as she jumped down with her bundles, while he reflected, looking over her slight person: “She don't look much on housework, but she ain't a fretter, anyhow.” But it was not only that the coming to his house of a bit of hopeful young life was like the lighting of a fire on a cold hearth. The girl was more than the bright serviceable creature he had thought her.

He had always been more sensitive than the people about him to the appeal of natural beauty. His unfinished studies had given form to this sensibility and even in his unhappiest moments field and sky spoke to him with a deep and powerful persuasion. But hitherto the emotion had remained in him as a silent ache, veiling with sadness the beauty that evoked it. He did not even know whether any one else in the world felt as he did, or whether he was the sole victim of this mournful privilege. Then he learned that one other spirit had trembled with the same touch of wonder: that at his side, living under his roof and eating his bread, was a creature to whom he could say: “That's Orion down yonder; the big fellow to the right is Aldebaran, and the bunch of little ones—like bees swarming—they're the Pleiades...” or whom he could hold entranced before a ledge of granite thrusting up through the fern while he unrolled the huge panorama of the ice age, and the long dim stretches of succeeding time. The fact that admiration for his learning mingled with Mattie's wonder at what he taught was not the least part of his pleasure. And there were other sensations, less definable but more exquisite, which drew them together with a shock of silent joy: the cold red of sunset behind winter hills, the flight of cloud-flocks over slopes of golden stubble, or the intensely blue shadows of hemlocks on sunlit snow. When she said to him once: “It looks just as if it was painted!” it seemed to Ethan that the art of definition could go no farther, and that words had at last been found to utter his secret soul....</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000119\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000119\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>As he stood in the darkness outside the church these memories came back with the poignancy of vanished things. Watching Mattie whirl down the floor from hand to hand he wondered how he could ever have thought that his dull talk interested her. To him, who was never gay but in her presence, her gaiety seemed plain proof of indifference. The face she lifted to her dancers was the same which, when she saw him, always looked like a window that has caught the sunset. He even noticed two or three gestures which, in his fatuity, he had thought she kept for him: a way of throwing her head back when she was amused, as if to taste her laugh before she let it out, and a trick of sinking her lids slowly when anything charmed or moved her.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000120\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000120\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The sight made him unhappy, and his unhappiness roused his latent fears. His wife had never shown any jealousy of Mattie, but of late she had grumbled increasingly over the house-work and found oblique ways of attracting attention to the girl's inefficiency. Zeena had always been what Starkfield called “sickly,” and Frome had to admit that, if she were as ailing as she believed, she needed the help of a stronger arm than the one which lay so lightly in his during the night walks to the farm. Mattie had no natural turn for housekeeping, and her training had done nothing to remedy the defect. She was quick to learn, but forgetful and dreamy, and not disposed to take the matter seriously. Ethan had an idea that if she were to marry a man she was fond of the dormant instinct would wake, and her pies and biscuits become the pride of the county; but domesticity in the abstract did not interest her. At first she was so awkward that he could not help laughing at her; but she laughed with him and that made them better friends. He did his best to supplement her unskilled efforts, getting up earlier than usual to light the kitchen fire, carrying in the wood overnight, and neglecting the mill for the farm that he might help her about the house during the day.

As he lay there he could hear Mattie moving about in her room, and her candle, sending its small ray across the landing, drew a scarcely perceptible line of light under his door. He kept his eyes fixed on the light till it vanished. Then the room grew perfectly black, and not a sound was audible but Zeena's asthmatic breathing. Ethan felt confusedly that there were many things he ought to think about, but through his tingling veins and tired brain only one sensation throbbed: the warmth of Mattie's shoulder against his. Why had he not kissed her when he held her there? A few hours earlier he would not have asked himself the question. Even a few minutes earlier, when they had stood alone outside the house, he would not have dared to think of kissing her. But since he had seen her lips in the lamplight he felt that they were his.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000231\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000231\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Now, in the bright morning air, her face was still before him.

Mattie Silver was the daughter of a cousin of Zenobia Frome's, who had inflamed his clan with mingled sentiments of envy and admiration by descending from the hills to Connecticut, where he had married a Stamford girl and succeeded to her father's thriving “drug” business. Unhappily Orin Silver, a man of far-reaching aims, had died too soon to prove that the end justifies the means. His accounts revealed merely what the means had been; and these were such that it was fortunate for his wife and daughter that his books were examined only after his impressive funeral. His wife died of the disclosure, and Mattie, at twenty, was left alone to make her way on the fifty dollars obtained from the sale of her piano. For this purpose her equipment, though varied, was inadequate. She could trim a hat, make molasses candy, recite “Curfew shall not ring to-night,” and play “The Lost Chord” and a pot-pourri from “Carmen.” When she tried to extend the field of her activities in the direction of stenography and book-keeping her health broke down, and six months on her feet behind the counter of a department store did not tend to restore it. Her nearest relations had been induced to place their savings in her father's hands, and though, after his death, they ungrudgingly acquitted themselves of the Christian duty of returning good for evil by giving his daughter all the advice at their disposal, they could hardly be expected to supplement it by material aid. But when Zenobia's doctor recommended her looking about for some one to help her with the house-work the clan instantly saw the chance of exacting a compensation from Mattie. Zenobia, though doubtful of the girl's efficiency, was tempted by the freedom to find fault without much risk of losing her; and so Mattie came to Starkfield.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000234\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000234\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Zenobia's fault-finding was of the silent kind, but not the less penetrating for that.

There was in him a slumbering spark of sociability which the long Starkfield winters had not yet extinguished. By nature grave and inarticulate, he admired recklessness and gaiety in others and was warmed to the marrow by friendly human intercourse. At Worcester, though he had the name of keeping to himself and not being much of a hand at a good time, he had secretly gloried in being clapped on the back and hailed as “Old Ethe” or “Old Stiff”; and the cessation of such familiarities had increased the chill of his return to Starkfield.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000258\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000258\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>There the silence had deepened about him year by year. Left alone, after his father's accident, to carry the burden of farm and mill, he had had no time for convivial loiterings in the village; and when his mother fell ill the loneliness of the house grew more oppressive than that of the fields. His mother had been a talker in her day, but after her “trouble” the sound of her voice was seldom heard, though she had not lost the power of speech. Sometimes, in the long winter evenings, when in desperation her son asked her why she didn't “say something,” she would lift a finger and answer: “Because I'm listening”; and on stormy nights, when the loud wind was about the house, she would complain, if he spoke to her: “They're talking so out there that I can't hear you.”</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000259\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000259\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>It was only when she drew toward her last illness, and his cousin Zenobia Pierce came over from the next valley to help him nurse her, that human speech was heard again in the house. After the mortal silence of his long imprisonment Zeena's volubility was music in his ears. He felt that he might have “gone like his mother” if the sound of a new voice had not come to steady him. Zeena seemed to understand his case at a glance. She laughed at him for not knowing the simplest sick-bed duties and told him to “go right along out” and leave her to see to things. The mere fact of obeying her orders, of feeling free to go about his business again and talk with other men, restored his shaken balance and magnified his sense of what he owed her. Her efficiency shamed and dazzled him. She seemed to possess by instinct all the household wisdom that his long apprenticeship had not instilled in him. When the end came it was she who had to tell him to hitch up and go for the undertaker, and she thought it “funny” that he had not settled beforehand who was to have his mother's clothes and the sewing-machine. After the funeral, when he saw her preparing to go away, he was seized with an unreasoning dread of being left alone on the farm; and before he knew what he was doing he had asked her to stay there with him. He had often thought since that it would not have happened if his mother had died in spring instead of winter...</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000260\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000260\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>When they married it was agreed that, as soon as he could straighten out the difficulties resulting from Mrs. Frome's long illness, they would sell the farm and saw-mill and try their luck in a large town. Ethan's love of nature did not take the form of a taste for agriculture. He had always wanted to be an engineer, and to live in towns, where there were lectures and big libraries and “fellows doing things.” A slight engineering job in Florida, put in his way during his period of study at Worcester, increased his faith in his ability as well as his eagerness to see the world; and he felt sure that, with a “smart” wife like Zeena, it would not be long before he had made himself a place in it.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000261\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000261\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Zeena's native village was slightly larger and nearer to the railway than Starkfield, and she had let her husband see from the first that life on an isolated farm was not what she had expected when she married. But purchasers were slow in coming, and while he waited for them Ethan learned the impossibility of transplanting her. She chose to look down on Starkfield, but she could not have lived in a place which looked down on her. Even Bettsbridge or Shadd's Falls would not have been sufficiently aware of her, and in the greater cities which attracted Ethan she would have suffered a complete loss of identity. And within a year of their marriage she developed the “sickliness” which had since made her notable even in a community rich in pathological instances. When she came to take care of his mother she had seemed to Ethan like the very genius of health, but he soon saw that her skill as a nurse had been acquired by the absorbed observation of her own symptoms.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000262\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000262\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Then she too fell silent. Perhaps it was the inevitable effect of life on the farm, or perhaps, as she sometimes said, it was because Ethan “never listened.” The charge was not wholly unfounded. When she spoke it was only to complain, and to complain of things not in his power to remedy; and to check a tendency to impatient retort he had first formed the habit of not answering her, and finally of thinking of other things while she talked. Of late, however, since he had reasons for observing her more closely, her silence had begun to trouble him. He recalled his mother's growing taciturnity, and wondered if Zeena were also turning “queer.” Women did, he knew. Zeena, who had at her fingers' ends the pathological chart of the whole region, had cited many cases of the kind while she was nursing his mother; and he himself knew of certain lonely farm-houses in the neighbourhood where stricken creatures pined, and of others where sudden tragedy had come of their presence. At times, looking at Zeena's shut face, he felt the chill of such forebodings. At other times her silence seemed deliberately assumed to conceal far-reaching intentions, mysterious conclusions drawn from suspicions and resentments impossible to guess. That supposition was even more disturbing than the other; and it was the one which had come to him the night before, when he had seen her standing in the kitchen door.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000263\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000263\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Now her departure for Bettsbridge had once more eased his mind, and all his thoughts were on the prospect of his evening with Mattie.

All the long misery of his baffled past, of his youth of failure, hardship and vain effort, rose up in his soul in bitterness and seemed to take shape before him in the woman who at every turn had barred his way. She had taken everything else from him; and now she meant to take the one thing that made up for all the others. For a moment such a flame of hate rose in him that it ran down his arm and clenched his fist against her. He took a wild step forward and then stopped.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000480\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000480\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>“You're—you're not coming down?” he said in a bewildered voice.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000481\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000481\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>“No. I guess I'll lay down on the bed a little while,” she answered mildly; and he turned and walked out of the room.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000482\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/14dbb91acade9691/text/000000482\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-14dbb91acade9691-8f4a13 twpub-14dbb91acade9691-9d49af twpub-14dbb91acade9691-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the kitchen Mattie was sitting by the stove, the cat curled up on her knees.

He remembered the shyness he had felt at approaching her in his uncouth clothes, and then the lighting up of her face, and the way she had broken through the group to come to him with a cup in her hand. They had sat for a few minutes on the fallen log by the pond, and she had missed her gold locket, and set the young men searching for it; and it was Ethan who had spied it in the moss....

It made a small frightened cheep like a field mouse, and he wondered languidly if it were hurt. Then he understood that it must be in pain: pain so excruciating that he seemed, mysteriously, to feel it shooting through his own body. He tried in vain to roll over in the direction of the sound, and stretched his left arm out across the snow. And now it was as though he felt rather than heard the twittering; it seemed to be under his palm, which rested on something soft and springy.

OR USE THIS WORK\\n<br>\\n<br>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free\\n<br>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work\\n<br>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project\\n<br>Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at\\n<br>http://gutenberg.org/license).\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic works\\n<br>\\n<br>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to\\n<br>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property\\n<br>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all\\n<br>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy\\n<br>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.\\n<br>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the\\n<br>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or\\n<br>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.B.  “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark.  It may only be\\n<br>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who\\n<br>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few\\n<br>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n<br>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See\\n<br>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement\\n<br>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\n<br>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation”\\n<br> or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the\\n<br>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an\\n<br>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are\\n<br>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from\\n<br>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative\\n<br>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg\\n<br>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by\\n<br>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of\\n<br>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with\\n<br>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by\\n<br>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\\n<br>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in\\n<br>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check\\n<br>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement\\n<br>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or\\n<br>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning\\n<br>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United\\n<br>States.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate\\n<br>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently\\n<br>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the\\n<br>phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project\\n<br>Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,\\n<br>copied or distributed:\\n<br>\\n<br>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\\n<br>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or\\n<br>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\\n<br>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived\\n<br>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is\\n<br>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied\\n<br>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees\\n<br>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work\\n<br>with the phrase “Project Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the\\n<br>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1\\n<br>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or\\n<br>1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted\\n<br>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution\\n<br>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional\\n<br>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked\\n<br>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the\\n<br>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this\\n<br>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this\\n<br>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without\\n<br>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with\\n<br>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,\\n<br>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any\\n<br>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or\\n<br>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than\\n<br>“Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version\\n<br>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),\\n<br>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a\\n<br>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon\\n<br>request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other\\n<br>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,\\n<br>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works\\n<br>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing\\n<br>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided\\n<br>that\\n<br>\\n<br>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from\\n<br>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method\\n<br>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is\\n<br>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he\\n<br>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the\\n<br>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments\\n<br>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you\\n<br>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax\\n<br>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and\\n<br>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the\\n<br>     address specified in Section 4, “Information about donations to\\n<br>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.”\\n<br>\\n<br>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies\\n<br>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\\n<br>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>     License.  You must require such a user to return or\\n<br>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium\\n<br>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of\\n<br>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.\\n<br>\\n<br>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any\\n<br>     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the\\n<br>     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days\\n<br>     of receipt of the work.\\n<br>\\n<br>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free\\n<br>     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set\\n<br>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from\\n<br>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael\\n<br>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the\\n<br>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\\n<br>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\\n<br>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\n<br>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\\n<br>“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\\n<br>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\\n<br>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\\n<br>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\\n<br>your equipment.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right\\n<br>of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\n<br>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\n<br>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\\n<br>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\\n<br>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\\n<br>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\\n<br>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\\n<br>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\\n<br>DAMAGE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\\n<br>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\\n<br>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\\n<br>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\\n<br>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\\n<br>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\\n<br>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\\n<br>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\\n<br>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\\n<br>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\\n<br>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\\n<br>opportunities to fix the problem.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\\n<br>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER\\n<br>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\\n<br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\\n<br>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\\n<br>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\\n<br>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\\n<br>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\\n<br>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\\n<br>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\n<br>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\n<br>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\\n<br>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\\n<br>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\\n<br>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\\n<br>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\\n<br>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\n<br>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\n<br>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\n<br>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\n<br>people in all walks of life.\\n<br>\\n<br>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\n<br>assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\n<br>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\n<br>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\n<br>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\n<br>To learn more

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\n<br>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\n<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\n<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\n<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n<br>\\n<br>     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\n<br>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\n<br>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\n<br>subscribe to our email
