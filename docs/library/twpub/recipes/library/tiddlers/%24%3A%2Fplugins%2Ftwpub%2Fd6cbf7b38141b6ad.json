Nevertheless it is clear that such persons as the writer of these notes not only may, but positively must, exist in our society, when we consider the circumstances in the midst of which our society is formed.

We will not dispute it; my contention was absurd. But yet I am firmly persuaded that a great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a disease. I stick to that. Let us leave that, too, for a minute. Tell me this: why does it happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments when I am most capable of feeling every refinement of all that is “sublime and beautiful,” as they used to say at one time, it would, as though of design, happen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly things, such that ... Well, in short, actions that all, perhaps, commit; but which, as though purposely, occurred to me at the very time when I was most conscious that they ought not to be committed. The more conscious I was of goodness and of all that was “sublime and beautiful,” the more deeply I sank into my mire and the more ready I was to sink in it altogether. But the chief point was that all this was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as though it were bound to be so. It was as though it were my most normal condition, and not in the least disease or depravity, so that at last all desire in me to struggle against this depravity passed. It ended by my almost believing (perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal condition. But at first, in the beginning, what agonies I endured in that struggle! I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all my life I hid this fact about myself as a secret. I was ashamed (even now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had committed a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last—into positive real enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment! I insist upon that. I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of one’s own degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even if time and faith were still left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000053\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000053\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000054\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000054\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in accord with the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness, and with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that consequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely nothing.

I am as suspicious and prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf.

I say, in earnest, that I should probably have been able to discover even in that a peculiar sort of enjoyment—the enjoyment, of course, of despair; but in despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one’s position. And when one is slapped in the face—why then the consciousness of being rubbed into a pulp would positively overwhelm one. The worst of it is, look at it which way one will, it still turns out that I was always the most to blame in everything. And what is most humiliating of all, to blame for no fault of my own but, so to say, through the laws of nature. In the first place, to blame because I am cleverer than any of the people surrounding me. (I have always considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding me, and sometimes, would you believe it, have been positively ashamed of it. At any rate, I have all my life, as it were, turned my eyes away and never could look people straight in the face.) To blame, finally, because even if I had had magnanimity, I should only have had more suffering from the sense of its uselessness. I should certainly have never been able to do anything from being magnanimous—neither to forgive, for my assailant would perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature, and one cannot forgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it were owing to the laws of nature, it is insulting all the same. Finally, even if I had wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had desired on the contrary to revenge myself on my assailant, I could not have revenged myself on any one for anything because I should certainly never have made up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able to. Why should I not have made up my mind?

Let us suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and it almost always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too. There may even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in <i>l’homme de la nature et de la vérité</i>. The base and nasty desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in <i>l’homme de la nature et de la vérité</i>. For through his innate stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple; while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not believe in the justice of it. To come at last to the deed itself, to the very act of revenge. Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their healthy sides ache. Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its mouse-hole. There in its nasty, stinking, underground home our insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own imagination. It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things might happen, and will forgive nothing. Maybe it will begin to revenge itself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind the stove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to vengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom it revenges itself, while he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself. On its deathbed it will recall it all over again, with interest accumulated over all the years and ...</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000064\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000064\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000065\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000065\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in that conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for forty years, in that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful hopelessness of one’s position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again a minute later—that the savour of that strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies.

I had toothache for a whole month and I know there is. In that case, of course, people are not spiteful in silence, but moan; but they are not candid moans, they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole point. The enjoyment of the sufferer finds expression in those moans; if he did not feel enjoyment in them he would not moan. It is a good example, gentlemen, and I will develop it. Those moans express in the first place all the aimlessness of your pain, which is so humiliating to your consciousness; the whole legal system of nature on which you spit disdainfully, of course, but from which you suffer all the same while she does not. They express the consciousness that you have no enemy to punish, but that you have pain; the consciousness that in spite of all possible Wagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth; that if someone wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and if he does not, they will go on aching another three months; and that finally if you are still contumacious and still protest, all that is left you for your own gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with your fist as hard as you can, and absolutely nothing more. Well, these mortal insults, these jeers on the part of someone unknown, end at last in an enjoyment which sometimes reaches the highest degree of voluptuousness. I ask you, gentlemen, listen sometimes to the moans of an educated man of the nineteenth century suffering from toothache, on the second or third day of the attack, when he is beginning to moan, not as he moaned on the first day, that is, not simply because he has toothache, not just as any coarse peasant, but as a man affected by progress and European civilisation, a man who is “divorced from the soil and the national elements,” as they express it now-a-days. His moans become nasty, disgustingly malignant, and go on for whole days and nights. And of course he knows himself that he is doing himself no sort of good with his moans; he knows better than anyone that he is only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows that even the audience before whom he is making his efforts, and his whole family, listen to him with loathing, do not put a ha’porth of faith in him, and inwardly understand that he might moan differently, more simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing himself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy. Well, in all these recognitions and disgraces it is that there lies a voluptuous pleasure. As though he would say: “I am worrying you, I am lacerating your hearts, I am keeping everyone in the house awake. Well, stay awake then, you, too, feel every minute that I have toothache. I am not a hero to you now, as I tried to seem before, but simply a nasty person, an impostor. Well, so be it, then! I am very glad that you see through me. It is nasty for you to hear my despicable moans: well, let it be nasty; here I will let you have a nastier flourish in a minute....” You do not understand even now, gentlemen? No, it seems our development and our consciousness must go further to understand all the intricacies of this pleasure. You laugh? Delighted. My jests, gentlemen, are of course in bad taste, jerky, involved, lacking self-confidence. But of course that is because I do not respect myself. Can a man of perception respect himself at all?</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000081\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000081\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000082\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000082\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000083\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000083\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>V</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000084\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000084\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000085\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000085\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Come, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of his own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself?

Of course, a minute or so later I would realise wrathfully that it was all a lie, a revolting lie, an affected lie, that is, all this penitence, this emotion, these vows of reform. You will ask why did I worry myself with such antics: answer, because it was very dull to sit with one’s hands folded, and so one began cutting capers. That is really it. Observe yourselves more carefully, gentlemen, then you will understand that it is so. I invented adventures for myself and made up a life, so as at least to live in some way. How many times it has happened to me—well, for instance, to take offence simply on purpose, for nothing; and one knows oneself, of course, that one is offended at nothing; that one is putting it on, but yet one brings oneself at last to the point of being really offended. All my life I have had an impulse to play such pranks, so that in the end I could not control it in myself. Another time, twice, in fact, I tried hard to be in love. I suffered, too, gentlemen, I assure you. In the depth of my heart there was no faith in my suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but yet I did suffer, and in the real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside myself ... and it was all from <i>ennui</i>, gentlemen, all from <i>ennui;</i> inertia overcame me. You know the direct, legitimate fruit of consciousness is inertia, that is, conscious sitting-with-the-hands-folded. I have referred to this already. I repeat, I repeat with emphasis: all “direct” persons and men of action are active just because they are stupid and limited. How explain that? I will tell you: in consequence of their limitation they take immediate and secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way persuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that they have found an infallible foundation for their activity, and their minds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing. To begin to act, you know, you must first have your mind completely at ease and no trace of doubt left in it. Why, how am I, for example, to set my mind at rest? Where are the primary causes on which I am to build? Where are my foundations? Where am I to get them from? I exercise myself in reflection, and consequently with me every primary cause at once draws after itself another still more primary, and so on to infinity. That is just the essence of every sort of consciousness and reflection. It must be a case of the laws of nature again. What is the result of it in the end? Why, just the same. Remember I spoke just now of vengeance. (I am sure you did not take it in.) I said that a man revenges himself because he sees justice in it. Therefore he has found a primary cause, that is, justice. And so he is at rest on all sides, and consequently he carries out his revenge calmly and successfully, being persuaded that he is doing a just and honest thing. But I see no justice in it, I find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently if I attempt to revenge myself, it is only out of spite. Spite, of course, might overcome everything, all my doubts, and so might serve quite successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely because it is not a cause. But what is to be done if I have not even spite (I began with that just now, you know). In consequence again of those accursed laws of consciousness, anger in me is subject to chemical disintegration. You look into it, the object flies off into air, your reasons evaporate, the criminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes not a wrong but a phantom, something like the toothache, for which no one is to blame, and consequently there is only the same outlet left again—that is, to beat the wall as hard as you can. So you give it up with a wave of the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause. And try letting yourself be carried away by your feelings, blindly, without reflection, without a primary cause, repelling consciousness at least for a time; hate or love, if only not to sit with your hands folded. The day after tomorrow, at the latest, you will begin despising yourself for having knowingly deceived yourself. Result: a soap-bubble and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, do you know, perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to begin nor to finish anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000086\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000086\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000087\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000087\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000088\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000088\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>VI</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000089\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000089\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000090\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000090\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Oh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness! Heavens, how I should have respected myself, then. I should have respected myself because I should at least have been capable of being lazy; there would at least have been one quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I could have believed myself. Question: What is he? Answer: A sluggard; how very pleasant it would have been to hear that of oneself! It would mean that I was positively defined, it would mean that there was something to say about me. “Sluggard”—why, it is a calling and vocation, it is a career. Do not jest, it is so. I should then be a member of the best club by right, and should find my occupation in continually respecting myself. I knew a gentleman who prided himself all his life on being a connoisseur of Lafitte. He considered this as his positive virtue, and never doubted himself. He died, not simply with a tranquil, but with a triumphant conscience, and he was quite right, too. Then I should have chosen a career for myself, I should have been a sluggard and a glutton, not a simple one, but, for instance, one with sympathies for everything sublime and beautiful. How do you like that? I have long had visions of it. That “sublime and beautiful” weighs heavily on my mind at forty But that is at forty; then—oh, then it would have been different! I should have found for myself a form of activity in keeping with it, to be precise, drinking to the health of everything “sublime and beautiful.” I should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into my glass and then to drain it to all that is “sublime and beautiful.” I should then have turned everything into the sublime and the beautiful; in the nastiest, unquestionable trash, I should have sought out the sublime and the beautiful. I should have exuded tears like a wet sponge. An artist, for instance, paints a picture worthy of Gay. At once I drink to the health of the artist who painted the picture worthy of Gay, because I love all that is “sublime and beautiful.” An author has written <i>As you will:</i> at once I drink to the health of “anyone you will” because I love all that is “sublime and beautiful.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000091\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000091\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000092\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000092\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I should claim respect for doing so.

Oh, tell me, who was it first announced, who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things because he does not know his own interests; and that if he were enlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, man would at once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good and noble because, being enlightened and understanding his real advantage, he would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else, and we all know that not one man can, consciously, act against his own interests, consequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good? Oh, the babe! Oh, the pure, innocent child! Why, in the first place, when in all these thousands of years has there been a time when man has acted only from his own interest? What is to be done with the millions of facts that bear witness that men, <i>consciously</i>, that is fully understanding their real interests, have left them in the background and have rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger, compelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were, simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully, struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the darkness. So, I suppose, this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter to them than any advantage.... Advantage! What is advantage? And will you take it upon yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the advantage of man consists? And what if it so happens that a man’s advantage, <i>sometimes</i>, not only may, but even must, consist in his desiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself and not advantageous. And if so, if there can be such a case, the whole principle falls into dust. What do you think—are there such cases? You laugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only answer me: have man’s advantages been reckoned up with perfect certainty? Are there not some which not only have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any classification? You see, you gentlemen have, to the best of my knowledge, taken your whole register of human advantages from the averages of statistical figures and politico-economical formulas. Your advantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace—and so on, and so on. So that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly in opposition to all that list would to your thinking, and indeed mine, too, of course, be an obscurantist or an absolute madman: would not he? But, you know, this is what is surprising: why does it so happen that all these statisticians, sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon up human advantages invariably leave out one? They don’t even take it into their reckoning in the form in which it should be taken, and the whole reckoning depends upon that. It would be no greater matter, they would simply have to take it, this advantage, and add it to the list. But the trouble is, that this strange advantage does not fall under any classification and is not in place in any list. I have a friend for instance ... Ech! gentlemen, but of course he is your friend, too; and indeed there is no one, no one to whom he is not a friend! When he prepares for any undertaking this gentleman immediately explains to you, elegantly and clearly, exactly how he must act in accordance with the laws of reason and truth. What is more, he will talk to you with excitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with irony he will upbraid the short-sighted fools who do not understand their own interests, nor the true significance of virtue; and, within a quarter of an hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply through something inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will go off on quite a different tack—that is, act in direct opposition to what he has just been saying about himself, in opposition to the laws of reason, in opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition to everything ... I warn you that my friend is a compound personality and therefore it is difficult to blame him as an individual. The fact is, gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical) there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason, honour, peace, prosperity—in fact, in opposition to all those excellent and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all. “Yes, but it’s advantage all the same,” you will retort. But excuse me, I’ll make the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What matters is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks down all our classifications, and continually shatters every system constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact, it upsets everything. But before I mention this advantage to you, I want to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare that all these fine systems, all these theories for explaining to mankind their real normal interests, in order that inevitably striving to pursue these interests they may at once become good and noble—are, in my opinion, so far, mere logical exercises! Yes, logical exercises. Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing ... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare. Logically it does seem to follow from his arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only look about you: blood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as though it were champagne. Take the whole of the nineteenth century in which Buckle lived. Take Napoleon—the Great and also the present one. Take North America—the eternal union. Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein.... And what is it that civilisation softens in us? The only gain of civilisation for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations—and absolutely nothing more. And through the development of this many-sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed. In fact, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed that it is the most civilised gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it is simply because they are so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so familiar to us. In any case civilisation has made mankind if not more bloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more loathsomely bloodthirsty. In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever. Which is worse? Decide that for yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman history) was fond of sticking gold pins into her slave-girls’ breasts and derived gratification from their screams and writhings. You will say that that was in the comparatively barbarous times; that these are barbarous times too, because also, comparatively speaking, pins are stuck in even now; that though man has now learned to see more clearly than in barbarous ages, he is still far from having learnt to act as reason and science would dictate. But yet you are fully convinced that he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old bad habits, and when common sense and science have completely re-educated human nature and turned it in a normal direction. You are confident that then man will cease from <i>intentional</i> error and will, so to say, be compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests. That is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though to my mind it’s a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any caprice or will of his own, and that he himself is something of the nature of a piano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are, besides, things called the laws of nature; so that everything he does is not done by his willing it, but is done of itself, by the laws of nature. Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him. All human actions will then, of course, be tabulated according to these laws, mathematically, like tables of logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index; or, better still, there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly calculated and explained that there will be no more incidents or adventures in the world.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000098\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000098\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000099\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000099\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then—this is all what you say—new economic relations will be established, all ready-made and worked out with mathematical exactitude, so that every possible question will vanish in the twinkling of an eye, simply because every possible answer to it will be provided. Then the “Palace of Crystal” will be built. Then ... In fact, those will be halcyon days. Of course there is no guaranteeing (this is my comment) that it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then (for what will one have to do when everything will be calculated and tabulated), but on the other hand everything will be extraordinarily rational. Of course boredom may lead you to anything. It is boredom sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that would not matter. What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I dare say people will be thankful for the gold pins then. Man is stupid, you know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is not at all stupid, but he is so ungrateful that you could not find another like him in all creation. I, for instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a sudden, <i>à propos</i> of nothing, in the midst of general prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and ironical, countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to us all: “I say, gentleman, hadn’t we better kick over the whole show and scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish will!” That again would not matter, but what is annoying is that he would be sure to find followers—such is the nature of man. And all that for the most foolish reason, which, one would think, was hardly worth mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at all times, whoever he may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his reason and advantage dictated. And one may choose what is contrary to one’s own interests, and sometimes one <i>positively ought</i> (that is my idea). One’s own free unfettered choice, one’s own caprice, however wild it may be, one’s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy—is that very “most advantageous advantage” which we have overlooked, which comes under no classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms. And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What has made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice? What man wants is simply <i>independent</i> choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead.

For who would want to choose by rule? Besides, he will at once be transformed from a human being into an organ-stop or something of the sort; for what is a man without desires, without free will and without choice, if not a stop in an organ?

We sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in our foolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a supposed advantage. But when all that is explained and worked out on paper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and senseless to suppose that some laws of nature man will never understand), then certainly so-called desires will no longer exist. For if a desire should come into conflict with reason we shall then reason and not desire, because it will be impossible retaining our reason to be <i>senseless</i> in our desires, and in that way knowingly act against reason and desire to injure ourselves. And as all choice and reasoning can be really calculated—because there will some day be discovered the laws of our so-called free will—so, joking apart, there may one day be something like a table constructed of them, so that we really shall choose in accordance with it. If, for instance, some day they calculate and prove to me that I made a long nose at someone because I could not help making a long nose at him and that I had to do it in that particular way, what <i>freedom</i> is left me, especially if I am a learned man and have taken my degree somewhere? Then I should be able to calculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand. In short, if this could be arranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we should have to understand that. And, in fact, we ought unwearyingly to repeat to ourselves that at such and such a time and in such and such circumstances nature does not ask our leave; that we have got to take her as she is and not fashion her to suit our fancy, and if we really aspire to formulas and tables of rules, and well, even ... to the chemical retort, there’s no help for it, we must accept the retort too, or else it will be accepted without our consent....”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000109\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000109\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000110\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000110\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Yes, but here I come to a stop! Gentlemen, you must excuse me for being over-philosophical; it’s the result of forty years underground! Allow me to indulge my fancy. You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there’s no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational side of man’s nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots. Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and human nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously or unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives. I suspect, gentlemen, that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me again that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the future man will be, cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous to himself, that that can be proved mathematically. I thoroughly agree, it can—by mathematics. But I repeat for the hundredth time, there is one case, one only, when man may consciously, purposely, desire what is injurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid—simply in order to have the right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not to be bound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible. Of course, this very stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen, more advantageous for us than anything else on earth, especially in certain cases. And in particular it may be more advantageous than any advantage even when it does us obvious harm, and contradicts the soundest conclusions of our reason concerning our advantage—for in any circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most important—that is, our personality, our individuality. Some, you see, maintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind; choice can, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason; and especially if this be not abused but kept within bounds. It is profitable and sometimes even praiseworthy. But very often, and even most often, choice is utterly and stubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you know that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy? Gentlemen, let us suppose that man is not stupid. (Indeed one cannot refuse to suppose that, if only from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid, then who is wise?) But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful! Phenomenally ungrateful. In fact, I believe that the best definition of man is the ungrateful biped. But that is not all, that is not his worst defect; his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual—from the days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period. Moral obliquity and consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been accepted that lack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity. Put it to the test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind. What will you see? Is it a grand spectacle? Grand, if you like. Take the Colossus of Rhodes, for instance, that’s worth something. With good reason Mr. Anaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work of man’s hands, while others maintain that it has been created by nature herself. Is it many-coloured? May be it is many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress uniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples in all ages—that alone is worth something, and if you take the undress uniforms you will never get to the end of it; no historian would be equal to the job. Is it monotonous? May be it’s monotonous too: it’s fighting and fighting; they are fighting now, they fought first and they fought last—you will admit, that it is almost too monotonous. In short, one may say anything about the history of the world—anything that might enter the most disordered imagination. The only thing one can’t say is that it’s rational. The very word sticks in one’s throat. And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually happening: there are continually turning up in life moral and rational persons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all their lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light to their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world. And yet we all know that those very people sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer trick, often a most unseemly one. Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself—as though that were so necessary—that men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals), may be by his curse alone he will attain his object—that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated—chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we don’t know?</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000111\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000111\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000112\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000112\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one is touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my will should of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own normal interests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000113\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000113\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000114\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000114\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we come to tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice two make four?

I am, perhaps, jesting against the grain. Gentlemen, I am tormented by questions; answer them for me. You, for instance, want to cure men of their old habits and reform their will in accordance with science and good sense. But how do you know, not only that it is possible, but also that it is <i>desirable</i> to reform man in that way? And what leads you to the conclusion that man’s inclinations <i>need</i> reforming? In short, how do you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man? And to go to the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law for mankind? So far, you know, this is only your supposition. It may be the law of logic, but not the law of humanity. You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad? Allow me to defend myself. I agree that man is pre-eminently a creative animal, predestined to strive consciously for an object and to engage in engineering—that is, incessantly and eternally to make new roads, <i>wherever they may lead</i>. But the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just be that he is <i>predestined</i> to make the road, and perhaps, too, that however stupid the “direct” practical man may be, the thought sometimes will occur to him that the road almost always does lead <i>somewhere</i>, and that the destination it leads to is less important than the process of making it, and that the chief thing is to save the well-conducted child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices. Man likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. But why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also? Tell me that! But on that point I want to say a couple of words myself. May it not be that he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no disputing that he does sometimes love it) because he is instinctively afraid of attaining his object and completing the edifice he is constructing?

But man is a frivolous and incongruous creature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the process of the game, not the end of it. And who knows (there is no saying with certainty), perhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind is striving lies in this incessant process of attaining, in other words, in life itself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must always be expressed as a formula, as positive as twice two makes four, and such positiveness is not life, gentlemen, but is the beginning of death. Anyway, man has always been afraid of this mathematical certainty, and I am afraid of it now. Granted that man does nothing but seek that mathematical certainty, he traverses oceans, sacrifices his life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it, dreads, I assure you. He feels that when he has found it there will be nothing for him to look for. When workmen have finished their work they do at least receive their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken to the police-station—and there is occupation for a week. But where can man go? Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him when he has attained such objects. He loves the process of attaining, but does not quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd. In fact, man is a comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it all. But yet mathematical certainty is after all, something insufferable. Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of insolence. Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your path and spitting. I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000122\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000122\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000123\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000123\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the normal and the positive—in other words, only what is conducive to welfare—is for the advantage of man? Is not reason in error as regards advantage? Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as great a benefit to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering, and that is a fact. There is no need to appeal to universal history to prove that; only ask yourself, if you are a man and have lived at all. As far as my personal opinion is concerned, to care only for well-being seems to me positively ill-bred. Whether it’s good or bad, it is sometimes very pleasant, too, to smash things. I hold no brief for suffering nor for well-being either. I am standing for ... my caprice, and for its being guaranteed to me when necessary. Suffering would be out of place in vaudevilles, for instance; I know that. In the “Palace of Crystal” it is unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the good of a “palace of crystal” if there could be any doubt about it? And yet I think man will never renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and chaos. Why, suffering is the sole origin of consciousness. Though I did lay it down at the beginning that consciousness is the greatest misfortune for man, yet I know man prizes it and would not give it up for any satisfaction. Consciousness, for instance, is infinitely superior to twice two makes four. Once you have mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to understand. There will be nothing left but to bottle up your five senses and plunge into contemplation. While if you stick to consciousness, even though the same result is attained, you can at least flog yourself at times, and that will, at any rate, liven you up. Reactionary as it is, corporal punishment is better than nothing.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000124\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000124\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000125\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000125\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000126\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000126\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>X</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000127\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000127\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000128\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000128\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>You believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed—a palace at which one will not be able to put out one’s tongue or make a long nose on the sly.

The more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in his mind. Anyway, I have only lately determined to remember some of my early adventures. Till now I have always avoided them, even with a certain uneasiness. Now, when I am not only recalling them, but have actually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the experiment whether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly open and not take fright at the whole truth. I will observe, in parenthesis, that Heine says that a true autobiography is almost an impossibility, and that man is bound to lie about himself. He considers that Rousseau certainly told lies about himself in his confessions, and even intentionally lied, out of vanity. I am convinced that Heine is right; I quite understand how sometimes one may, out of sheer vanity, attribute regular crimes to oneself, and indeed I can very well conceive that kind of vanity. But Heine judged of people who made their confessions to the public. I write only for myself, and I wish to declare once and for all that if I write as though I were addressing readers, that is simply because it is easier for me to write in that form. It is a form, an empty form—I shall never have readers.

My life was even then gloomy, ill-regulated, and as solitary as that of a savage. I made friends with no one and positively avoided talking, and buried myself more and more in my hole. At work in the office I never looked at anyone, and was perfectly well aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as a queer fellow, but even looked upon me—I always fancied this—with a sort of loathing. I sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except me fancied that he was looked upon with aversion? One of the clerks had a most repulsive, pock-marked face, which looked positively villainous. I believe I should not have dared to look at anyone with such an unsightly countenance. Another had such a very dirty old uniform that there was an unpleasant odour in his proximity. Yet not one of these gentlemen showed the slightest self-consciousness—either about their clothes or their countenance or their character in any way. Neither of them ever imagined that they were looked at with repulsion; if they had imagined it they would not have minded—so long as their superiors did not look at them in that way. It is clear to me now that, owing to my unbounded vanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often looked at myself with furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and so I inwardly attributed the same feeling to everyone. I hated my face, for instance: I thought it disgusting, and even suspected that there was something base in my expression, and so every day when I turned up at the office I tried to behave as independently as possible, and to assume a lofty expression, so that I might not be suspected of being abject. “My face may be ugly,” I thought, “but let it be lofty, expressive, and, above all, <i>extremely</i> intelligent.” But I was positively and painfully certain that it was impossible for my countenance ever to express those qualities. And what was worst of all, I thought it actually stupid looking, and I would have been quite satisfied if I could have looked intelligent. In fact, I would even have put up with looking base if, at the same time, my face could have been thought strikingly intelligent.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000178\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000178\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000179\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000179\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Of course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them all, yet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them. In fact, it happened at times that I thought more highly of them than of myself. It somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them and thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments. But whether I despised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes almost every time I met anyone. I even made experiments whether I could face so and so’s looking at me, and I was always the first to drop my eyes. This worried me to distraction. I had a sickly dread, too, of being ridiculous, and so had a slavish passion for the conventional in everything external. I loved to fall into the common rut, and had a whole-hearted terror of any kind of eccentricity in myself. But how could I live up to it? I was morbidly sensitive as a man of our age should be. They were all stupid, and as like one another as so many sheep. Perhaps I was the only one in the office who fancied that I was a coward and a slave, and I fancied it just because I was more highly developed. But it was not only that I fancied it, it really was so. I was a coward and a slave. I say this without the slightest embarrassment. Every decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave. That is his normal condition. Of that I am firmly persuaded. He is made and constructed to that very end. And not only at the present time owing to some casual circumstances, but always, at all times, a decent man is bound to be a coward and a slave. It is the law of nature for all decent people all over the earth. If anyone of them happens to be valiant about something, he need not be comforted nor carried away by that; he would show the white feather just the same before something else. That is how it invariably and inevitably ends. Only donkeys and mules are valiant, and they only till they are pushed up to the wall. It is not worth while to pay attention to them for they really are of no consequence.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000180\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000180\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000181\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000181\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Another circumstance, too, worried me in those days: that there was no one like me and I was unlike anyone else. “I am alone and they are <i>everyone</i>,” I thought—and pondered.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000182\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000182\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000183\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000183\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>From that it is evident that I was still a youngster.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000184\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000184\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000185\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000185\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The very opposite sometimes happened.

We, in Russia, have no fools; that is well known. That is what distinguishes us from foreign lands. Consequently these transcendental natures are not found amongst us in their pure form. The idea that they are is due to our “realistic” journalists and critics of that day, always on the look out for Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr Ivanitchs and foolishly accepting them as our ideal; they have slandered our romantics, taking them for the same transcendental sort as in Germany or France. On the contrary, the characteristics of our “romantics” are absolutely and directly opposed to the transcendental European type, and no European standard can be applied to them. (Allow me to make use of this word “romantic”—an old-fashioned and much respected word which has done good service and is familiar to all.) The characteristics of our romantic are to understand everything, <i>to see everything and to see it often incomparably more clearly than our most realistic minds see it;</i> to refuse to accept anyone or anything, but at the same time not to despise anything; to give way, to yield, from policy; never to lose sight of a useful practical object (such as rent-free quarters at the government expense, pensions, decorations), to keep their eye on that object through all the enthusiasms and volumes of lyrical poems, and at the same time to preserve “the sublime and the beautiful” inviolate within them to the hour of their death, and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious jewel wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of “the sublime and the beautiful.” Our “romantic” is a man of great breadth and the greatest rogue of all our rogues, I assure you.... I can assure you from experience, indeed. Of course, that is, if he is intelligent. But what am I saying! The romantic is always intelligent, and I only meant to observe that although we have had foolish romantics they don’t count, and they were only so because in the flower of their youth they degenerated into Germans, and to preserve their precious jewel more comfortably, settled somewhere out there—by preference in Weimar or the Black Forest.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000188\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000188\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000189\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000189\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I, for instance, genuinely despised my official work and did not openly abuse it simply because I was in it myself and got a salary for it.

Our romantic would rather go out of his mind—a thing, however, which very rarely happens—than take to open abuse, unless he had some other career in view; and he is never kicked out. At most, they would take him to the lunatic asylum as “the King of Spain” if he should go very mad. But it is only the thin, fair people who go out of their minds in Russia. Innumerable “romantics” attain later in life to considerable rank in the service. Their many-sidedness is remarkable! And what a faculty they have for the most contradictory sensations! I was comforted by this thought even in those days, and I am of the same opinion now. That is why there are so many “broad natures” among us who never lose their ideal even in the depths of degradation; and though they never stir a finger for their ideal, though they are arrant thieves and knaves, yet they tearfully cherish their first ideal and are extraordinarily honest at heart. Yes, it is only among us that the most incorrigible rogue can be absolutely and loftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to be a rogue. I repeat, our romantics, frequently, become such accomplished rascals (I use the term “rascals” affectionately), suddenly display such a sense of reality and practical knowledge that their bewildered superiors and the public generally can only ejaculate in amazement.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000190\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000190\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000191\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000191\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Their many-sidedness is really amazing, and goodness knows what it may develop into later on, and what the future has in store for us.

For of the point of honour—not of honour, but of the point of honour (<i>point d’honneur</i>)—one cannot speak among us except in literary language. You can’t allude to the “point of honour” in ordinary language. I was fully convinced (the sense of reality, in spite of all my romanticism!) that they would all simply split their sides with laughter, and that the officer would not simply beat me, that is, without insulting me, but would certainly prod me in the back with his knee, kick me round the billiard-table, and only then perhaps have pity and drop me out of the window.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000214\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000214\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000215\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000215\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Of course, this trivial incident could not with me end in that.

It was difficult for me to do so, for I knew no one. But one day I heard someone shout his surname in the street as I was following him at a distance, as though I were tied to him—and so I learnt his surname. Another time I followed him to his flat, and for ten kopecks learned from the porter where he lived, on which storey, whether he lived alone or with others, and so on—in fact, everything one could learn from a porter. One morning, though I had never tried my hand with the pen, it suddenly occurred to me to write a satire on this officer in the form of a novel which would unmask his villainy. I wrote the novel with relish. I did unmask his villainy, I even exaggerated it; at first I so altered his surname that it could easily be recognised, but on second thoughts I changed it, and sent the story to the <i>Otetchestvenniya Zapiski</i>. But at that time such attacks were not the fashion and my story was not printed.

I used to wriggle along in a most unseemly fashion, like an eel, continually moving aside to make way for generals, for officers of the guards and the hussars, or for ladies. At such minutes there used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart, and I used to feel hot all down my back at the mere thought of the wretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and abjectness of my little scurrying figure. This was a regular martyrdom, a continual, intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant and direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this world, a nasty, disgusting fly—more intelligent, more highly developed, more refined in feeling than any of them, of course—but a fly that was continually making way for everyone, insulted and injured by everyone.

Black gloves seemed to me both more dignified and <i>bon ton</i> than the lemon-coloured ones which I had contemplated at first. “The colour is too gaudy, it looks as though one were trying to be conspicuous,” and I did not take the lemon-coloured ones. I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt, with white bone studs; my overcoat was the only thing that held me back. The coat in itself was a very good one, it kept me warm; but it was wadded and it had a raccoon collar which was the height of vulgarity. I had to change the collar at any sacrifice, and to have a beaver one like an officer’s. For this purpose I began visiting the Gostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a piece of cheap German beaver. Though these German beavers soon grow shabby and look wretched, yet at first they look exceedingly well, and I only needed it for the occasion. I asked the price; even so, it was too expensive. After thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon collar. The rest of the money—a considerable sum for me, I decided to borrow from Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an unassuming person, though grave and judicious. He never lent money to anyone, but I had, on entering the service, been specially recommended to him by an important personage who had got me my berth. I was horribly worried. To borrow from Anton Antonitch seemed to me monstrous and shameful. I did not sleep for two or three nights. Indeed, I did not sleep well at that time, I was in a fever; I had a vague sinking at my heart or else a sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing! Anton Antonitch was surprised at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, and did after all lend me the money, receiving from me a written authorisation to take from my salary a fortnight later the sum that he had lent me.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000230\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000230\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000231\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000231\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In this way everything was at last ready.

It was followed by remorse—I tried to drive it away; I felt too sick. By degrees, however, I grew used to that too. I grew used to everything, or rather I voluntarily resigned myself to enduring it. But I had a means of escape that reconciled everything—that was to find refuge in “the sublime and the beautiful,” in dreams, of course. I was a terrible dreamer, I would dream for three months on end, tucked away in my corner, and you may believe me that at those moments I had no resemblance to the gentleman who, in the perturbation of his chicken heart, put a collar of German beaver on his great-coat. I suddenly became a hero. I would not have admitted my six-foot lieutenant even if he had called on me. I could not even picture him before me then. What were my dreams and how I could satisfy myself with them—it is hard to say now, but at the time I was satisfied with them. Though, indeed, even now, I am to some extent satisfied with them. Dreams were particularly sweet and vivid after a spell of dissipation; they came with remorse and with tears, with curses and transports. There were moments of such positive intoxication, of such happiness, that there was not the faintest trace of irony within me, on my honour. I had faith, hope, love. I believed blindly at such times that by some miracle, by some external circumstance, all this would suddenly open out, expand; that suddenly a vista of suitable activity—beneficent, good, and, above all, <i>ready made</i> (what sort of activity I had no idea, but the great thing was that it should be all ready for me)—would rise up before me—and I should come out into the light of day, almost riding a white horse and crowned with laurel. Anything but the foremost place I could not conceive for myself, and for that very reason I quite contentedly occupied the lowest in reality. Either to be a hero or to grovel in the mud—there was nothing between. That was my ruin, for when I was in the mud I comforted myself with the thought that at other times I was a hero, and the hero was a cloak for the mud: for an ordinary man it was shameful to defile himself, but a hero was too lofty to be utterly defiled, and so he might defile himself. It is worth noting that these attacks of the “sublime and the beautiful” visited me even during the period of dissipation and just at the times when I was touching the bottom. They came in separate spurts, as though reminding me of themselves, but did not banish the dissipation by their appearance. On the contrary, they seemed to add a zest to it by contrast, and were only sufficiently present to serve as an appetising sauce. That sauce was made up of contradictions and sufferings, of agonising inward analysis, and all these pangs and pin-pricks gave a certain piquancy, even a significance to my dissipation—in fact, completely answered the purpose of an appetising sauce. There was a certain depth of meaning in it. And I could hardly have resigned myself to the simple, vulgar, direct debauchery of a clerk and have endured all the filthiness of it. What could have allured me about it then and have drawn me at night into the street? No, I had a lofty way of getting out of it all.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000239\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000239\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000240\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000240\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at times in those dreams of mine! in those “flights into the sublime and the beautiful”; though it was fantastic love, though it was never applied to anything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that one did not feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality; that would have been superfluous. Everything, however, passed satisfactorily by a lazy and fascinating transition into the sphere of art, that is, into the beautiful forms of life, lying ready, largely stolen from the poets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs and uses. I, for instance, was triumphant over everyone; everyone, of course, was in dust and ashes, and was forced spontaneously to recognise my superiority, and I forgave them all. I was a poet and a grand gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless millions and immediately devoted them to humanity, and at the same time I confessed before all the people my shameful deeds, which, of course, were not merely shameful, but had in them much that was “sublime and beautiful” something in the Manfred style. Everyone would kiss me and weep (what idiots they would be if they did not), while I should go barefoot and hungry preaching new ideas and fighting a victorious Austerlitz against the obscurantists. Then the band would play a march, an amnesty would be declared, the Pope would agree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then there would be a ball for the whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on the shores of Lake Como, Lake Como being for that purpose transferred to the neighbourhood of Rome; then would come a scene in the bushes, and so on, and so on—as though you did not know all about it?

Can you imagine that I am ashamed of it all, and that it was stupider than anything in your life, gentlemen? And I can assure you that some of these fancies were by no means badly composed.... It did not all happen on the shores of Lake Como. And yet you are right—it really is vulgar and contemptible. And most contemptible of all it is that now I am attempting to justify myself to you.

Of the daughters one was thirteen and another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was awfully shy of them because they were always whispering and giggling together. The master of the house usually sat in his study on a leather couch in front of the table with some grey-headed gentleman, usually a colleague from our office or some other department. I never saw more than two or three visitors there, always the same. They talked about the excise duty; about business in the senate, about salaries, about promotions, about His Excellency, and the best means of pleasing him, and so on. I had the patience to sit like a fool beside these people for four hours at a stretch, listening to them without knowing what to say to them or venturing to say a word.

I had hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because he was a pretty and playful boy. He was always bad at his lessons and got worse and worse as he went on; however, he left with a good certificate, as he had powerful interests.

He was vulgar in the extreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured fellow, even in his swaggering. In spite of superficial, fantastic and sham notions of honour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled before Zverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered. And it was not from any interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he had been favoured by the gifts of nature. Moreover, it was, as it were, an accepted idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact and the social graces. This last fact particularly infuriated me. I hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his admiration of his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid, though he was bold in his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which I would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent one), and the free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the “’forties.” I hated the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women (he did not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the epaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to them with impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting. I remember how I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon Zverkov, when one day talking at a leisure moment with his schoolfellows of his future relations with the fair sex, and growing as sportive as a puppy in the sun, he all at once declared that he would not leave a single village girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was his <i>droit de seigneur</i>, and that if the peasants dared to protest he would have them all flogged and double the tax on them, the bearded rascals. Our servile rabble applauded, but I attacked him, not from compassion for the girls and their fathers, but simply because they were applauding such an insect. I got the better of him on that occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and impudent, and so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was not really complete; the laugh was on his side. He got the better of me on several occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually. I remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him. When we left school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for I was flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally. Afterwards I heard of his barrack-room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life he was leading. Then there came other rumours—of his successes in the service. By then he had taken to cutting me in the street, and I suspected that he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a personage as insignificant as me. I saw him once in the theatre, in the third tier of boxes. By then he was wearing shoulder-straps. He was twisting and twirling about, ingratiating himself with the daughters of an ancient General. In three years he had gone off considerably, though he was still rather handsome and adroit. One could see that by the time he was thirty he would be corpulent. So it was to this Zverkov that my schoolfellows were going to give a dinner on his departure. They had kept up with him for those three years, though privately they did not consider themselves on an equal footing with him, I am convinced of that.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000256\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000256\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000257\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000257\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Of Simonov’s two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German—a little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always deriding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the lower forms—a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most sensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a wretched little coward at heart. He was one of those worshippers of Zverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often borrowed money from him. Simonov’s other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a person in no way remarkable—a tall young fellow, in the army, with a cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort, and was only capable of thinking of promotion. He was some sort of distant relation of Zverkov’s, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him a certain importance among us. He always thought me of no consequence whatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was tolerable.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000258\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000258\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000259\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000259\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Well, with seven roubles each,” said Trudolyubov, “twenty-one roubles between the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner.

No wonder; all the evening I had been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school, and I could not shake them off. I was sent to the school by distant relations, upon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing since—they sent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by their reproaches, already troubled by doubt, and looking with savage distrust at everyone. My schoolfellows met me with spiteful and merciless jibes because I was not like any of them. But I could not endure their taunts; I could not give in to them with the ignoble readiness with which they gave in to one another. I hated them from the first, and shut myself away from everyone in timid, wounded and disproportionate pride. Their coarseness revolted me. They laughed cynically at my face, at my clumsy figure; and yet what stupid faces they had themselves. In our school the boys’ faces seemed in a special way to degenerate and grow stupider. How many fine-looking boys came to us! In a few years they became repulsive. Even at sixteen I wondered at them morosely; even then I was struck by the pettiness of their thoughts, the stupidity of their pursuits, their games, their conversations. They had no understanding of such essential things, they took no interest in such striking, impressive subjects, that I could not help considering them inferior to myself. It was not wounded vanity that drove me to it, and for God’s sake do not thrust upon me your hackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, that “I was only a dreamer,” while they even then had an understanding of life. They understood nothing, they had no idea of real life, and I swear that that was what made me most indignant with them. On the contrary, the most obvious, striking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and even at that time were accustomed to respect success. Everything that was just, but oppressed and looked down upon, they laughed at heartlessly and shamefully. They took rank for intelligence; even at sixteen they were already talking about a snug berth. Of course, a great deal of it was due to their stupidity, to the bad examples with which they had always been surrounded in their childhood and boyhood. They were monstrously depraved. Of course a great deal of that, too, was superficial and an assumption of cynicism; of course there were glimpses of youth and freshness even in their depravity; but even that freshness was not attractive, and showed itself in a certain rakishness. I hated them horribly, though perhaps I was worse than any of them. They repaid me in the same way, and did not conceal their aversion for me. But by then I did not desire their affection: on the contrary, I continually longed for their humiliation. To escape from their derision I purposely began to make all the progress I could with my studies and forced my way to the very top. This impressed them. Moreover, they all began by degrees to grasp that I had already read books none of them could read, and understood things (not forming part of our school curriculum) of which they had not even heard. They took a savage and sarcastic view of it, but were morally impressed, especially as the teachers began to notice me on those grounds. The mockery ceased, but the hostility remained, and cold and strained relations became permanent between us. In the end I could not put up with it: with years a craving for society, for friends, developed in me. I attempted to get on friendly terms with some of my schoolfellows; but somehow or other my intimacy with them was always strained and soon ended of itself. Once, indeed, I did have a friend. But I was already a tyrant at heart; I wanted to exercise unbounded sway over him; I tried to instil into him a contempt for his surroundings; I required of him a disdainful and complete break with those surroundings. I frightened him with my passionate affection; I reduced him to tears, to hysterics. He was a simple and devoted soul; but when he devoted himself to me entirely I began to hate him immediately and repulsed him—as though all I needed him for was to win a victory over him, to subjugate him and nothing else. But I could not subjugate all of them; my friend was not at all like them either, he was, in fact, a rare exception. The first thing I did on leaving school was to give up the special job for which I had been destined so as to break all ties, to curse my past and shake the dust from off my feet.... And goodness knows why, after all that, I should go trudging off to Simonov’s!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000330\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000330\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000331\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000331\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Early next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with excitement, as though it were all about to happen at once. But I believed that some radical change in my life was coming, and would inevitably come that day. Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external event, however trivial, always made me feel as though some radical change in my life were at hand. I went to the office, however, as usual, but sneaked away home two hours earlier to get ready. The great thing, I thought, is not to be the first to arrive, or they will think I am overjoyed at coming. But there were thousands of such great points to consider, and they all agitated and overwhelmed me. I polished my boots a second time with my own hands; nothing in the world would have induced Apollon to clean them twice a day, as he considered that it was more than his duties required of him. I stole the brushes to clean them from the passage, being careful he should not detect it, for fear of his contempt. Then I minutely examined my clothes and thought that everything looked old, worn and threadbare. I had let myself get too slovenly. My uniform, perhaps, was tidy, but I could not go out to dinner in my uniform. The worst of it was that on the knee of my trousers was a big yellow stain. I had a foreboding that that stain would deprive me of nine-tenths of my personal dignity. I knew, too, that it was very poor to think so. “But this is no time for thinking: now I am in for the real thing,” I thought, and my heart sank. I knew, too, perfectly well even then, that I was monstrously exaggerating the facts. But how could I help it? I could not control myself and was already shaking with fever. With despair I pictured to myself how coldly and disdainfully that “scoundrel” Zverkov would meet me; with what dull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead Trudolyubov would look at me; with what impudent rudeness the insect Ferfitchkin would snigger at me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely Simonov would take it all in, and how he would despise me for the abjectness of my vanity and lack of spirit—and, worst of all, how paltry, <i>unliterary</i>, commonplace it would all be. Of course, the best thing would be not to go at all. But that was most impossible of all: if I feel impelled to do anything, I seem to be pitchforked into it. I should have jeered at myself ever afterwards: “So you funked it, you funked it, you funked the <i>real thing!</i>” On the contrary, I passionately longed to show all that “rabble” that I was by no means such a spiritless creature as I seemed to myself. What is more, even in the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever, I dreamed of getting the upper hand, of dominating them, carrying them away, making them like me—if only for my “elevation of thought and unmistakable wit.” They would abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one side, silent and ashamed, while I should crush him. Then, perhaps, we would be reconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was most bitter and humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully and for certain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did not really want to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not care a straw really for the result, even if I did achieve it. Oh, how I prayed for the day to pass quickly! In unutterable anguish I went to the window, opened the movable pane and looked out into the troubled darkness of the thickly falling wet snow. At last my wretched little clock hissed out five. I seized my hat and, trying not to look at Apollon, who had been all day expecting his month’s wages, but in his foolishness was unwilling to be the first to speak about it, I slipped between him and the door and, jumping into a high-class sledge, on which I spent my last half rouble, I drove up in grand style to the Hôtel de Paris.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000332\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000332\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000333\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000333\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000334\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000334\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>IV</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000335\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000335\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000336\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000336\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive. But it was not a question of being the first to arrive. Not only were they not there, but I had difficulty in finding our room. The table was not laid even. What did it mean? After a good many questions I elicited from the waiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for six o’clock. This was confirmed at the buffet too. I felt really ashamed to go on questioning them. It was only twenty-five minutes past five. If they changed the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me know—that is what the post is for, and not to have put me in an absurd position in my own eyes and ... and even before the waiters. I sat down; the servant began laying the table; I felt even more humiliated when he was present. Towards six o’clock they brought in candles, though there were lamps burning in the room. It had not occurred to the waiter, however, to bring them in at once when I arrived. In the next room two gloomy, angry-looking persons were eating their dinners in silence at two different tables. There was a great deal of noise, even shouting, in a room further away; one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people, and nasty little shrieks in French: there were ladies at the dinner. It was sickening, in fact. I rarely passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did arrive all together punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them, as though they were my deliverers, and even forgot that it was incumbent upon me to show resentment.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000337\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000337\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000338\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000338\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading spirit. He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew himself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather jaunty bend from the waist. He shook hands with me in a friendly, but not over-friendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like that of a General, as though in giving me his hand he were warding off something. I had imagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would at once break into his habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making his insipid jokes and witticisms. I had been preparing for them ever since the previous day, but I had not expected such condescension, such high-official courtesy. So, then, he felt himself ineffably superior to me in every respect! If he only meant to insult me by that high-official tone, it would not matter, I thought—I could pay him back for it one way or another. But what if, in reality, without the least desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had a notion in earnest that he was superior to me and could only look at me in a patronising way?

I tried my very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet I purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels. But it was all in vain. They paid no attention. I had the patience to walk up and down in front of them from eight o’clock till eleven, in the same place, from the table to the stove and back again. “I walk up and down to please myself and no one can prevent me.” The waiter who came into the room stopped, from time to time, to look at me. I was somewhat giddy from turning round so often; at moments it seemed to me that I was in delirium. During those three hours I was three times soaked with sweat and dry again. At times, with an intense, acute pang I was stabbed to the heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty years would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember with loathing and humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most awful moments of my life. No one could have gone out of his way to degrade himself more shamelessly, and I fully realised it, fully, and yet I went on pacing up and down from the table to the stove. “Oh, if you only knew what thoughts and feelings I am capable of, how cultured I am!” I thought at moments, mentally addressing the sofa on which my enemies were sitting. But my enemies behaved as though I were not in the room. Once—only once—they turned towards me, just when Zverkov was talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh.

There, you see,” I added, though she made no answer, but only listened in silence, entirely absorbed, “that’s a bondage for you! You will never buy your freedom. They will see to that. It’s like selling your soul to the devil.... And besides ... perhaps, I too, am just as unlucky—how do you know—and wallow in the mud on purpose, out of misery? You know, men take to drink from grief; well, maybe I am here from grief. Come, tell me, what is there good here?

I grew up without a home; and perhaps that’s why I’ve turned so ... unfeeling.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000789\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000789\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000790\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000790\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I waited again. “Perhaps she doesn’t understand,” I thought, “and, indeed, it is absurd—it’s moralising.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000791\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000791\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000792\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000792\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“If I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my daughter more than my sons, really,” I began indirectly, as though talking of something else, to distract her attention.

Perhaps. Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning up his troubles, but does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he ought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it. And what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God is upon it, if the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you, never leaves you! There is happiness in such a family! Even sometimes there is happiness in the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is everywhere. If you marry <i>you will find out for yourself</i>. But think of the first years of married life with one you love: what happiness, what happiness there sometimes is in it! And indeed it’s the ordinary thing. In those early days even quarrels with one’s husband end happily. Some women get up quarrels with their husbands just because they love them. Indeed, I knew a woman like that: she seemed to say that because she loved him, she would torment him and make him feel it. You know that you may torment a man on purpose through love. Women are particularly given to that, thinking to themselves ‘I will love him so, I will make so much of him afterwards, that it’s no sin to torment him a little now.’ And all in the house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are happy and gay and peaceful and honourable.... Then there are some women who are jealous. If he went off anywhere—I knew one such woman, she couldn’t restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off on the sly to find out where he was, whether he was with some other woman. That’s a pity. And the woman knows herself it’s wrong, and her heart fails her and she suffers, but she loves—it’s all through love. And how sweet it is to make up after quarrels, to own herself in the wrong or to forgive him! And they both are so happy all at once—as though they had met anew, been married over again; as though their love had begun afresh. And no one, no one should know what passes between husband and wife if they love one another. And whatever quarrels there may be between them they ought not to call in their own mother to judge between them and tell tales of one another. They are their own judges. Love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens. That makes it holier and better. They respect one another more, and much is built on respect. And if once there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away? Surely one can keep it! It is rare that one cannot keep it. And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last? The first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will come a love that is better still. Then there will be the union of souls, they will have everything in common, there will be no secrets between them. And once they have children, the most difficult times will seem to them happy, so long as there is love and courage. Even toil will be a joy, you may deny yourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy, They will love you for it afterwards; so you are laying by for your future. As the children grow up you feel that you are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your children will always keep your thoughts and feelings, because they have received them from you, they will take on your semblance and likeness. So you see this is a great duty. How can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer? People say it’s a trial to have children. Who says that? It is heavenly happiness! Are you fond of little children, Liza? I am awfully fond of them. You know—a little rosy baby boy at your bosom, and what husband’s heart is not touched, seeing his wife nursing his child! A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand everything. And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little hand, plays. When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again. Or it will bite its mother’s breast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, ‘Look, I am biting!’ Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, husband, wife and child? One can forgive a great deal for the sake of such moments.

How can you talk about being like a book, when it makes even me, an outsider, feel sick? Though I don’t look at it as an outsider, for, indeed, it touches me to the heart.... Is it possible, is it possible that you do not feel sick at being here yourself? Evidently habit does wonders! God knows what habit can do with anyone. Can you seriously think that you will never grow old, that you will always be good-looking, and that they will keep you here for ever and ever? I say nothing of the loathsomeness of the life here.... Though let me tell you this about it—about your present life, I mean; here though you are young now, attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet you know as soon as I came to myself just now I felt at once sick at being here with you! One can only come here when one is drunk. But if you were anywhere else, living as good people live, I should perhaps be more than attracted by you, should fall in love with you, should be glad of a look from you, let alone a word; I should hang about your door, should go down on my knees to you, should look upon you as my betrothed and think it an honour to be allowed to. I should not dare to have an impure thought about you. But here, you see, I know that I have only to whistle and you have to come with me whether you like it or not. I don’t consult your wishes, but you mine. The lowest labourer hires himself as a workman, but he doesn’t make a slave of himself altogether; besides, he knows that he will be free again presently. But when are you free? Only think what you are giving up here? What is it you are making a slave of? It is your soul, together with your body; you are selling your soul which you have no right to dispose of! You give your love to be outraged by every drunkard! Love! But that’s everything, you know, it’s a priceless diamond, it’s a maiden’s treasure, love—why, a man would be ready to give his soul, to face death to gain that love. But how much is your love worth now? You are sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no need to strive for love when you can have everything without love. And you know there is no greater insult to a girl than that, do you understand? To be sure, I have heard that they comfort you, poor fools, they let you have lovers of your own here. But you know that’s simply a farce, that’s simply a sham, it’s just laughing at you, and you are taken in by it! Why, do you suppose he really loves you, that lover of yours? I don’t believe it. How can he love you when he knows you may be called away from him any minute? He would be a low fellow if he did! Will he have a grain of respect for you? What have you in common with him? He laughs at you and robs you—that is all his love amounts to! You are lucky if he does not beat you. Very likely he does beat you, too. Ask him, if you have got one, whether he will marry you. He will laugh in your face, if he doesn’t spit in it or give you a blow—though maybe he is not worth a bad halfpenny himself. And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of it? For the coffee they give you to drink and the plentiful meals? But with what object are they feeding you up? An honest girl couldn’t swallow the food, for she would know what she was being fed for. You are in debt here, and, of course, you will always be in debt, and you will go on in debt to the end, till the visitors here begin to scorn you. And that will soon happen, don’t rely upon your youth—all that flies by express train here, you know. You will be kicked out. And not simply kicked out; long before that she’ll begin nagging at you, scolding you, abusing you, as though you had not sacrificed your health for her, had not thrown away your youth and your soul for her benefit, but as though you had ruined her, beggared her, robbed her. And don’t expect anyone to take your part: the others, your companions, will attack you, too, win her favour, for all are in slavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here long ago. They have become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is viler, more loathsome, and more insulting than their abuse. And you are laying down everything here, unconditionally, youth and health and beauty and hope, and at twenty-two you will look like a woman of five-and-thirty, and you will be lucky if you are not diseased, pray to God for that! No doubt you are thinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do! Yet there is no work harder or more dreadful in the world or ever has been. One would think that the heart alone would be worn out with tears. And you won’t dare to say a word, not half a word when they drive you away from here; you will go away as though you were to blame. You will change to another house, then to a third, then somewhere else, till you come down at last to the Haymarket. There you will be beaten at every turn; that is good manners there, the visitors don’t know how to be friendly without beating you. You don’t believe that it is so hateful there? Go and look for yourself some time, you can see with your own eyes. Once, one New Year’s Day, I saw a woman at a door. They had turned her out as a joke, to give her a taste of the frost because she had been crying so much, and they shut the door behind her. At nine o’clock in the morning she was already quite drunk, dishevelled, half-naked, covered with bruises, her face was powdered, but she had a black-eye, blood was trickling from her nose and her teeth; some cabman had just given her a drubbing. She was sitting on the stone steps, a salt fish of some sort was in her hand; she was crying, wailing something about her luck and beating with the fish on the steps, and cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in the doorway taunting her. You don’t believe that you will ever be like that? I should be sorry to believe it, too, but how do you know; maybe ten years, eight years ago that very woman with the salt fish came here fresh as a cherub, innocent, pure, knowing no evil, blushing at every word. Perhaps she was like you, proud, ready to take offence, not like the others; perhaps she looked like a queen, and knew what happiness was in store for the man who should love her and whom she should love. Do you see how it ended? And what if at that very minute when she was beating on the filthy steps with that fish, drunken and dishevelled—what if at that very minute she recalled the pure early days in her father’s house, when she used to go to school and the neighbour’s son watched for her on the way, declaring that he would love her as long as he lived, that he would devote his life to her, and when they vowed to love one another for ever and be married as soon as they were grown up! No, Liza, it would be happy for you if you were to die soon of consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that woman just now. In the hospital, do you say? You will be lucky if they take you, but what if you are still of use to the madam here? Consumption is a queer disease, it is not like fever. The patient goes on hoping till the last minute and says he is all right. He deludes himself And that just suits your madam. Don’t doubt it, that’s how it is; you have sold your soul, and what is more you owe money, so you daren’t say a word. But when you are dying, all will abandon you, all will turn away from you, for then there will be nothing to get from you. What’s more, they will reproach you for cumbering the place, for being so long over dying. However you beg you won’t get a drink of water without abuse: ‘Whenever are you going off, you nasty hussy, you won’t let us sleep with your moaning, you make the gentlemen sick.’ That’s true, I have heard such things said myself. They will thrust you dying into the filthiest corner in the cellar—in the damp and darkness; what will your thoughts be, lying there alone? When you die, strange hands will lay you out, with grumbling and impatience; no one will bless you, no one will sigh for you, they only want to get rid of you as soon as may be; they will buy a coffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor woman today, and celebrate your memory at the tavern. In the grave, sleet, filth, wet snow—no need to put themselves out for you—‘Let her down, Vanuha; it’s just like her luck—even here, she is head-foremost, the hussy. Shorten the cord, you rascal.’ ‘It’s all right as it is.’ ‘All right, is it? Why, she’s on her side! She was a fellow-creature, after all! But, never mind, throw the earth on her.’ And they won’t care to waste much time quarrelling over you. They will scatter the wet blue clay as quick as they can and go off to the tavern ... and there your memory on earth will end; other women have children to go to their graves, fathers, husbands. While for you neither tear, nor sigh, nor remembrance; no one in the whole world will ever come to you, your name will vanish from the face of the earth—as though you had never existed, never been born at all! Nothing but filth and mud, however you knock at your coffin lid at night, when the dead arise, however you cry: ‘Let me out, kind people, to live in the light of day! My life was no life at all; my life has been thrown away like a dish-clout; it was drunk away in the tavern at the Haymarket; let me out, kind people, to live in the world again.’”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000836\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000836\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000837\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000837\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And I worked myself up to such a pitch that I began to have a lump in my throat myself, and ... and all at once I stopped, sat up in dismay and, bending over apprehensively, began to listen with a beating heart.

She was lying on her face, thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching it in both hands. Her heart was being torn. Her youthful body was shuddering all over as though in convulsions. Suppressed sobs rent her bosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing, then she pressed closer into the pillow: she did not want anyone here, not a living soul, to know of her anguish and her tears. She bit the pillow, bit her hand till it bled (I saw that afterwards), or, thrusting her fingers into her dishevelled hair, seemed rigid with the effort of restraint, holding her breath and clenching her teeth. I began saying something, begging her to calm herself, but felt that I did not dare; and all at once, in a sort of cold shiver, almost in terror, began fumbling in the dark, trying hurriedly to get dressed to go. It was dark; though I tried my best I could not finish dressing quickly. Suddenly I felt a box of matches and a candlestick with a whole candle in it. As soon as the room was lighted up, Liza sprang up, sat up in bed, and with a contorted face, with a half insane smile, looked at me almost senselessly. I sat down beside her and took her hands; she came to herself, made an impulsive movement towards me, would have caught hold of me, but did not dare, and slowly bowed her head before me.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000842\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000842\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000843\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000843\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Liza, my dear, I was wrong ... forgive me, my dear,” I began, but she squeezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the wrong thing and stopped.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000844\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000844\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000845\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000845\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“This is my address, Liza, come to me.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000846\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000846\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000847\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000847\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“I will come,” she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000848\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000848\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000849\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000849\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“But now I am going, good-bye ... till we meet again.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000850\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000850\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000851\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000851\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I got up; she, too, stood up and suddenly flushed all over, gave a shudder, snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled herself in it to her chin.

But I did not know then, that fifteen years later I should still in my imagination see Liza, always with the pitiful, distorted, inappropriate smile which was on her face at that minute.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000885\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000885\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000886\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000886\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Next day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to over-excited nerves, and, above all, as <i>exaggerated</i>.

He drove me beyond all patience! He was the bane of my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence. We had been squabbling continually for years, and I hated him. My God, how I hated him! I believe I had never hated anyone in my life as I hated him, especially at some moments. He was an elderly, dignified man, who worked part of his time as a tailor. But for some unknown reason he despised me beyond all measure, and looked down upon me insufferably. Though, indeed, he looked down upon everyone. Simply to glance at that flaxen, smoothly brushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his forehead and oiled with sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth, compressed into the shape of the letter V, made one feel one was confronting a man who never doubted of himself. He was a pedant, to the most extreme point, the greatest pedant I had met on earth, and with that had a vanity only befitting Alexander of Macedon. He was in love with every button on his coat, every nail on his fingers—absolutely in love with them, and he looked it! In his behaviour to me he was a perfect tyrant, he spoke very little to me, and if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm, majestically self-confident and invariably ironical look that drove me sometimes to fury. He did his work with the air of doing me the greatest favour, though he did scarcely anything for me, and did not, indeed, consider himself bound to do anything. There could be no doubt that he looked upon me as the greatest fool on earth, and that “he did not get rid of me” was simply that he could get wages from me every month. He consented to do nothing for me for seven roubles a month. Many sins should be forgiven me for what I suffered from him. My hatred reached such a point that sometimes his very step almost threw me into convulsions. What I loathed particularly was his lisp. His tongue must have been a little too long or something of that sort, for he continually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it, imagining that it greatly added to his dignity. He spoke in a slow, measured tone, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground. He maddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to himself behind his partition. Many a battle I waged over that reading! But he was awfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow, even, sing-song voice, as though over the dead. It is interesting that that is how he has ended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over the dead, and at the same time he kills rats and makes blacking. But at that time I could not get rid of him, it was as though he were chemically combined with my existence. Besides, nothing would have induced him to consent to leave me. I could not live in furnished lodgings: my lodging was my private solitude, my shell, my cave, in which I concealed myself from all mankind, and Apollon seemed to me, for some reason, an integral part of that flat, and for seven years I could not turn him away.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000903\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000903\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000904\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000000904\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>To be two or three days behind with his wages, for instance, was impossible.

He would begin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare, keeping it up for several minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me or seeing me out of the house. If I held out and pretended not to notice these stares, he would, still in silence, proceed to further tortures. All at once, <i>à propos</i> of nothing, he would walk softly and smoothly into my room, when I was pacing up and down or reading, stand at the door, one hand behind his back and one foot behind the other, and fix upon me a stare more than severe, utterly contemptuous.

But perhaps I am worse than you myself.

Of course, I couldn’t keep it up then, because I am a wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the devil knows why, gave you my address in my folly. Afterwards, before I got home, I was cursing and swearing at you because of that address, I hated you already because of the lies I had told you. Because I only like playing with words, only dreaming, but, do you know, what I really want is that you should all go to hell. That is what I want. I want peace; yes, I’d sell the whole world for a farthing, straight off, so long as I was left in peace. Is the world to go to pot, or am I to go without my tea? I say that the world may go to pot for me so long as I always get my tea. Did you know that, or not? Well, anyway, I know that I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist, a sluggard. Here I have been shuddering for the last three days at the thought of your coming. And do you know what has worried me particularly for these three days? That I posed as such a hero to you, and now you would see me in a wretched torn dressing-gown, beggarly, loathsome. I told you just now that I was not ashamed of my poverty; so you may as well know that I am ashamed of it; I am more ashamed of it than of anything, more afraid of it than of being found out if I were a thief, because I am as vain as though I had been skinned and the very air blowing on me hurt. Surely by now you must realise that I shall never forgive you for having found me in this wretched dressing-gown, just as I was flying at Apollon like a spiteful cur. The saviour, the former hero, was flying like a mangy, unkempt sheep-dog at his lackey, and the lackey was jeering at him! And I shall never forgive you for the tears I could not help shedding before you just now, like some silly woman put to shame! And for what I am confessing to you now, I shall never forgive you either! Yes—you must answer for it all because you turned up like this, because I am a blackguard, because I am the nastiest, stupidest, absurdest and most envious of all the worms on earth, who are not a bit better than I am, but, the devil knows why, are never put to confusion; while I shall always be insulted by every louse, that is my doom! And what is it to me that you don’t understand a word of this! And what do I care, what do I care about you, and whether you go to ruin there or not? Do you understand? How I shall hate you now after saying this, for having been here and listening. Why, it’s not once in a lifetime a man speaks out like this, and then it is in hysterics! ... What more do you want? Why do you still stand confronting me, after all this? Why are you worrying me? Why don’t you go?”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001016\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001016\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001017\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001017\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But at this point a strange thing happened.

But the trouble was that the hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the loathsome truth) lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust into my nasty leather pillow, I began by degrees to be aware of a far-away, involuntary but irresistible feeling that it would be awkward now for me to raise my head and look Liza straight in the face. Why was I ashamed? I don’t know, but I was ashamed. The thought, too, came into my overwrought brain that our parts now were completely changed, that she was now the heroine, while I was just a crushed and humiliated creature as she had been before me that night—four days before....

This cruelty was so affected, so purposely made up, so completely a product of the brain, of books, that I could not even keep it up a minute—first I dashed away to avoid seeing her, and then in shame and despair rushed after Liza. I opened the door in the passage and began listening.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001047\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001047\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001048\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001048\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Liza!

We are so divorced from it that we feel at once a sort of loathing for real life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of it. Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort, almost as hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in books. And why do we fuss and fume sometimes? Why are we perverse and ask for something else? We don’t know what ourselves. It would be the worse for us if our petulant prayers were answered. Come, try, give any one of us, for instance, a little more independence, untie our hands, widen the spheres of our activity, relax the control and we ... yes, I assure you ... we should be begging to be under control again at once. I know that you will very likely be angry with me for that, and will begin shouting and stamping. Speak for yourself, you will say, and for your miseries in your underground holes, and don’t dare to say all of us—excuse me, gentlemen, I am not justifying myself with that “all of us.” As for what concerns me in particular I have only in my life carried to an extreme what you have not dared to carry halfway, and what’s more, you have taken your cowardice for good sense, and have found comfort in deceiving yourselves. So that perhaps, after all, there is more life in me than in you. Look into it more carefully! Why, we don’t even know what living means now, what it is, and what it is called? Leave us alone without books and we shall be lost and in confusion at once. We shall not know what to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and what to hate, what to respect and what to despise. We are oppressed at being men—men with a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a disgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalised man. We are stillborn, and for generations past have been begotten, not by living fathers, and that suits us better and better. We are developing a taste for it. Soon we shall contrive to be born somehow from an idea. But enough; I don’t want to write more from “Underground.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001075\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001075\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001076\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d6cbf7b38141b6ad/text/000001076\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3e1261 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-3bb953 twpub-d6cbf7b38141b6ad-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\">[The notes of this paradoxalist do not end here, however.
