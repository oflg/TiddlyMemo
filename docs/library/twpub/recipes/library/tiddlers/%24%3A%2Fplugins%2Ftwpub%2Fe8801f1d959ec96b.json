For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G——, the Prefect of the Parisian police.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000024\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000024\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000025\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000025\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years.

The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question—a letter, to be frank—had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D——. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter—one of no importance—upon the table.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000078\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000078\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000079\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000079\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Here, then,” said Dupin to me, “you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete—the robber’s knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000080\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000080\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000081\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000081\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Yes,” replied the Prefect; “and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent.

the fact is, we took our time, and we searched <i>everywhere</i>. I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a ‘secret’ drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk—of space—to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000116\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000116\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000117\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000117\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Why so?”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000118\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000118\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000119\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000119\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced.

This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000198\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000198\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000199\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000199\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000200\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000200\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000201\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000201\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“The Parisian police,” he said, “are exceedingly able in their way.

A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of ‘even and odd’ attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, ‘are they even or odd?’ Our schoolboy replies, ‘odd,’ and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, ‘the simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;’—he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus: ‘This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore guess even;’—he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows termed ‘lucky,’—what, in its last analysis, is it?”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000210\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000210\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000211\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000211\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“It is merely,” I said, “an identification of the reasoner’s intellect with that of his opponent.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000212\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000212\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000213\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000213\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.’ This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000214\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000214\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000215\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000215\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“And the identification,” I said, “of the reasoner’s intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy with which the opponent’s intellect is admeasured.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000216\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000216\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000217\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000217\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“For its practical value it depends upon this,” replied Dupin; “and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They are right in this much—that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency—by some extraordinary reward—they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of D——, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches—what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,—not exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg—but, at least, in some out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherchés nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed—a disposal of it in this recherché manner,—is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance—or, what amounts to the same thing in the political eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,—the qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect’s examination—in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect—its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000218\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000218\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000219\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000219\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“But is this really the poet?” I asked. “There are two brothers, I know; and both have attained reputation in letters.

The French are the originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance—if words derive any value from applicability—then ‘analysis’ conveys ‘algebra’ about as much as, in Latin, ‘ambitus’ implies ‘ambition,’ ‘<i>religio</i>’ ‘religion,’ or ‘<i>homines honesti</i>’ a set of <i>honorable</i> men.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000226\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000226\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000227\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000227\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“You have a quarrel on hand, I see,” said I, “with some of the algebraists of Paris; but proceed.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000228\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000228\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000229\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000229\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is true of relation—of form and quantity—is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely general applicability—as the world indeed imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned ‘Mythology,’ mentions an analogous source of error, when he says that ‘although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing realities.’ With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans themselves, the ‘Pagan fables’ are believed, and the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x<sup>2</sup>+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x<sup>2</sup>+px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000230\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000230\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000231\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000231\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“I mean to say,” continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last observations, “that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate—and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate—the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G——, in fact, did finally arrive—the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed—I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice.

His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers—since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy—at least no pity—for him who descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms ‘a certain personage’ he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000262\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000262\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000263\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000263\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“How? did you put any thing particular in it?”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000264\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000264\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000265\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000265\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Why—it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank—that would have been insulting.

Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied convulsion—heaving, boiling, hissing—gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000448\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000448\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000449\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000449\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast. Suddenly—very suddenly—this assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000450\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000450\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000451\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000451\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked.

When it is flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea—it being constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000460\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000460\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000461\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000461\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex.

The idea generally received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands, “have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.”—These are the words of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part—the Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with him—for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000464\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000464\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000465\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000465\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old man, “and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000466\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000466\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000467\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000467\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000468\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000468\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000469\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000469\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh.

As we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act—although I knew he was a madman when he did it—a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did not care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask.

This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from present observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-ström. By far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way—so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters—but then I distinctly recollected that there were <i>some</i> of them which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been <i>completely absorbed</i>—that the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early, or absorbed more rapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The first was, that, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their descent—the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the one spherical, and the other <i>of any other shape</i>, the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere—the third, that, between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject with an old school-master of the district; and it was from him that I learned the use of the words ‘cylinder’ and ‘sphere.’ He explained to me—although I have forgotten the explanation—how what I observed was, in fact, the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments—and showed me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever.

As it is myself who now tell you this tale—as you see that I <i>did</i> escape—and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say—I will bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep. The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-ström <i>had been</i>. It was the hour of the slack—but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of the Ström, and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the ‘grounds’ of the fishermen. A boat picked me up—exhausted from fatigue—and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from the memory of its horror.

I need not go into details. My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its manner. It does not look true. Persons who are narrating facts, are seldom so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date and precise location. Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the discovery he says he did, at the period designated—nearly eight years ago—how happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have resulted to him individually, if not to the world at large, from the discovery? It seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby—so like an owl—as Mr. Kissam admits that he did. By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole paragraph in the ‘Courier and Enquirer’ a fabrication got up to ‘make a talk’? It must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air. Very little dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion; and if I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of science are mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry, I should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as Professor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam’s (or is it Mr. Quizzem’s?) pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a tone.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000543\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000543\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000544\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000544\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But to return to the ‘Diary’ of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet was not designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style. At page 13, for example, near the middle, we read, in reference to his researches about the protoxide of azote: ‘In less than half a minute the respiration being continued, diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.’ That the respiration was not ‘diminished,’ is not only clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural, ‘were.’ The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: ‘In less than half a minute, the respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminished gradually, and were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.’ A hundred similar instances go to show that the MS. so inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book, meant only for the writer’s own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet will convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion. The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics. Not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearing empirical; so that, however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in question, he would never have spoken out, until he had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration. I verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched, could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this ‘Diary’ (full of crude speculations) would have been unattended to; as, it seems, they were. I say ‘his wishes,’ for that he meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed ‘to be burnt,’ I think there can be no manner of doubt. Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet remains to be seen. That the passages quoted above, with the other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or disservice to mankind at large. That Von Kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to doubt for a moment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to ‘realize,’ in time, by large purchases of houses and land, with other property of intrinsic value.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000545\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000545\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000546\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000546\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the ‘Home Journal,’ and has since been extensively copied, several misapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by the translator, who professes to have taken the passage from a late number of the Presburg ‘Schnellpost.’ ‘Viele’ has evidently been misconceived (as it often is), and what the translator renders by ‘sorrows,’ is probably ‘lieden,’ which, in its true version, ‘sufferings,’ would give a totally different complexion to the whole account; but, of course, much of this is merely guess, on my part.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000547\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000547\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000548\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000548\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Von Kempelen, however, is by no means ‘a misanthrope,’ in appearance, at least, whatever he may be in fact.

In person, he is short and stout, with large, <i>fat</i>, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers, a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. There is some defect in one of his feet.

He left the hotel before me, intending to go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it was there that he was first suspected of having made it.

When the great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth &amp; Co., suspicion was directed toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having purchased a considerable property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when questioned, to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money. He was at length arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, was in the end set at liberty. The police, however, kept a strict watch upon his movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently, taking always the same road, and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the ‘Dondergat.’ Finally, by dint of great perseverance, they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven stories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,—and, coming upon him suddenly, found him, as they imagined, in the midst of his counterfeiting operations. His agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After hand-cuffing him, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he occupied all the mansarde.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000555\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000555\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000556\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000556\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet by eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object has not yet been ascertained.

One of these crucibles was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube, which was close to the brim. The other crucible had some liquid in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be furiously dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himself taken, Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased in gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw the contents on the tiled floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed him; and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person, but nothing unusual was found about him, excepting a paper parcel, in his coat-pocket, containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal proportions.

I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the topic of the soul’s immortality. I cannot deny that there has always existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of its own existence. But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do. All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more sceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied him in his own works as well as in those of his European and American echoes. The ‘Charles Elwood’ of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed in my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it logical, but the portions which were not <i>merely</i> logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his beginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, of France, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no hold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The will may assent—the soul—the intellect, never.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000584\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000584\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000585\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000585\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually believed.

We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous ether. Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our conception of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight. Destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity, or at least as matter. For want of a better word we might term it spirit. Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether—conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than the metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at a unique mass—an unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity. There will be a point—there will be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce. But the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It is clear, however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is, it is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible to imagine what is not. When we flatter ourselves that we have formed its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000650\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000650\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000651\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000651\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p><i>P.</i> There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of absolute coalescence;—and that is the very slight resistance experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space—a resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in <i>some</i> degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton.

The organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition, being unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one—the nature of the volition of God—that is to say, the motion of the unparticled matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is <i>not</i>; but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it <i>is</i>. A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether. The vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again communicate similar ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it. The motion of this latter is thought, of which perception is the first undulation. This is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and this external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the idiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and to this ether—in unison with it—the whole body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it. It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000702\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000702\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000703\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000703\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p><i>P.</i> You speak of rudimental “beings.” Are there other rudimental thinking beings than man?</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000704\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000704\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000705\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000705\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p><i>V.</i> The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulæ, planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulæ, suns, nor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying <i>pabulum</i> for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings.

Ernest Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the “Bibliotheca Forensica,” and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of “Wallenstein” and “Gargantua.” M. Valdemar, who has resided principally at Harlem, N.Y., since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person—his lower limbs much resembling those of John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his whiskers, in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair—the latter, in consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temperament was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment. On two or three occasions I had put him to sleep with little difficulty, but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate. His will was at no period positively, or thoroughly, under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was his custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000735\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000735\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000736\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000736\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was of course very natural that I should think of M.

The left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all purposes of vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also partially, if not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running one into another. Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one point, permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place. These appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date. The ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no sign of it had been discovered a month before, and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days. Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible.

There are, indeed, two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There were two particulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation—as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the voice seemed to reach our ears—at least mine—from a vast distance, or from some deep cavern within the earth.

But my disease grew upon me—for what disease is like Alcohol!—and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat peevish—even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill temper.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000846\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000846\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000847\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000847\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence.

The socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of P<small>ERVERSENESS</small>. Of this spirit philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart—one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which is <i>Law</i>, merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this unfathomable longing of the soul <i>to vex itself</i>—to offer violence to its own nature—to do wrong for the wrong’s sake only—that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;—hung it with the tears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart;—hung it <i>because</i> I knew that it had loved me, and <i>because</i> I felt it had given me no reason of offence;—hung it <i>because</i> I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin—a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it—if such a thing wore possible—even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000852\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000852\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000853\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000853\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire.

I know not how it was—but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene before me—upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the domain—upon the bleak walls—upon the vacant eye-like windows—upon a few rank sedges—and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees—with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium—the bitter lapse into everyday life—the hideous dropping off of the veil. There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart—an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime. What was it—I paused to think—what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there <i>are</i> combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down—but with a shudder even more thrilling than before—upon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and eye-like windows.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000903\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000903\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000904\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000904\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country—a letter from him—which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness—of a mental disorder which oppressed him—and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said—it was the apparent <i>heart</i> that went with his request—which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000905\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000905\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000906\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000906\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other—it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the “House of Usher”—an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000907\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000907\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000908\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000908\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment—that of looking down within the tarn—had been to deepen the first singular impression.

I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity—an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn—a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000909\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000909\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000910\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000910\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Shaking off from my spirit what <i>must</i> have been a dream, I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000911\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000911\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000912\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000912\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the <i>studio</i> of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me—while the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy—while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this—I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with trepidation and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000913\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000913\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000914\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000914\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.

A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000917\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000917\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000918\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000918\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence—an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy—an excessive nervous agitation.

By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least—in the circumstances then surrounding me—there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000933\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000933\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000934\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000934\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although feebly, in words.

This opinion, in its general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express the full extent, or the earnest <i>abandon</i> of his persuasion. The belief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stones—in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of the many <i>fungi</i> which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around—above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn. Its evidence—the evidence of the sentience—was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family, and which made <i>him</i> what I now saw him—what he was.

The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue—but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage.

Sleep came not near my couch—while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room—of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, harkened—I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me—to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the night), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000955\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000955\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000956\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000000956\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.

This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine.

But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. There were seven—an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different; as might have been expected from the duke’s love of the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue—and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange—the fifth with white—the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes here were scarlet—a deep blood color. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001033\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001033\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001034\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001034\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony.

But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies), there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001035\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001035\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001036\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001036\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.

There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams.

And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away—they have endured but an instant—and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001039\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001039\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001040\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001040\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001041\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001041\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001042\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001042\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince’s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death.

At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince’s person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple—through the purple to the green—through the green to the orange—through this again to the white—and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001051\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001051\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001052\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001052\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death.

In the pure arrogance of the reason, we have all overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through want of belief—of faith;—whether it be faith in Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the impulse—for the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We could not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;—we could not have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that phrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man, rather than the understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs—to dictate purposes to God. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that man should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness, and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be God’s will that man should continue his species, we discovered an organ of amativeness, forthwith. And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness,—so, in short, with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pure intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors; deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001239\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001239\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001240\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001240\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the Deity intended him to do.

In the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a <i>mobile</i> without motive, a motive not <i>motivirt</i>. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should <i>not</i>. In theory, no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible. I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable <i>force</i> which impels us, and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong’s sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive impulse—elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But a glance will show the fallacy of this idea. The phrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development. It follows, that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001243\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001243\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001244\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001244\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>An appeal to one’s own heart is, after all, the best reply to the sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness of the propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than distinctive. There lives no man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear; the most laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue; it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough. The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001245\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001245\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001246\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001246\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>We have a task before us which must be speedily performed.

This craving gathers strength as the moments fly. The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence of the conflict within us,—of the definite with the indefinite—of the substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the shadow which prevails,—we struggle in vain. The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare.

We peer into the abyss—we grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger. Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. But out of this our cloud upon the precipice’s edge, there grows into palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height. And this fall—this rushing annihilation—for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination—for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001249\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001249\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001250\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001250\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting solely from the spirit of the Perverse.

The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001263\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001263\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001264\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001264\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before concluding the brief but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the hangman and to hell.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001265\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001265\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001266\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001266\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001267\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001267\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001268\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001268\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But why shall I say more?

No more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise. And it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is, doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only one—which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, the presence—not of human life only, but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless—is a stain upon the landscape—is at war with the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,—I love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole—a whole whose form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain—a being which we, in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001276\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001276\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001277\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001277\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand—notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood—that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest possible amount of matter;—while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with God, that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it. And since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle—indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the operations of Deity,—it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within cycle without end,—yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the God-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast “clod of the valley” which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation.

She stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude seemed indicative of joy—but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. “The revolution which has just been made by the Fay,” continued I, musingly, “is the cycle of the brief year of her life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer.

Like some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the windows, and down the staircases of the Ducal Palace, turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001313\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001313\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001314\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001314\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal.

The light, almost slender symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength which he has been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of more dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity—singular, wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense and brilliant jet—and a profusion of curling, black hair, from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and ivory—his were features than which I have seen none more classically regular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet his countenance was, nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen at some period of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. It had no peculiar, it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten, but forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind. Not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any time, to throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face—but that the mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the passion, when the passion had departed.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001329\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001329\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001330\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001330\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me, in what I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him <i>very</i> early the next morning.

The sentence—the dread sentence of death—was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of <i>revolution</i>—perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief period, for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw—but with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed judges. They appeared to me white—whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words—and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness—of immoveable resolution—of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thought came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. Then silence, and stillness, night were the universe.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001384\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001384\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001385\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001385\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber—no! In delirium—no! In a swoon—no! In death—no! even in the grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond. And that gulf is—what? How at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I have termed the first stage are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower; is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001386\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001386\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001387\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001387\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down—down—still down—till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of that heart’s unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil.

I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard. There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I struggled for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition. The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead. Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence;—but where and in what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had been in immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001392\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001392\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001393\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001393\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility.

I tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall. In groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, at least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell.

My confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001412\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001412\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001413\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001413\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure.

The angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere.

It was the painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks. There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in wonder.

There had been a second change in the cell—and now the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain that I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of its iron angles were now acute—two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. But the alteration stopped not here—I neither hoped nor desired it to stop. I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace. “Death,” I said, “any death but that of the pit!” Fool! might I have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand its pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank back—but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward.

The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For three days the body was preserved unburied, during which it had acquired a stony rigidity.

The heroine of the story was a Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family, of wealth, and of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was Julien Bossuet, a poor <i>litterateur</i>, or journalist of Paris. His talents and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress, by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage, however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her. Having passed with him some wretched years, she died—at least her condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her. She was buried——not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the village of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the memory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital to the remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxuriant tresses. He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried alive. Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death. He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He employed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. She remained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her original health. Her woman’s heart was not adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her husband, but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to America. Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady’s appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her. They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting, Monsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife.

Although both the immediate and the predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still mysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood. Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the patient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species of exaggerated lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but the pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of warmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of the lungs. Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks—even for months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death. Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are, luckily, gradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal. The fits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the preceding. In this lies the principal security from inhumation. The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001505\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001505\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001506\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001506\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in medical books.

My nerves became thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home. In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends. I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went so far as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the most solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible. And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason—would accept no consolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. Among other things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within. The slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back. There were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light, and convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of the coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly and softly padded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the vault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the coffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas? what avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even these well-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001527\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001527\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001528\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001528\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>There arrived an epoch—as often before there had arrived—in which I found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first feeble and indefinite sense of existence.

Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then, after a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence, during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive effort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now a partial and evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regained its dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feel that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have been subject to catalepsy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean, my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger—by the one spectral and ever-prevalent idea.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001529\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001529\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001530\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001530\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without motion.

Accompanied by a friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the banks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken by a storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and laden with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We made the best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of the only two berths in the vessel—and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no bedding of any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Nevertheless, I slept soundly, and the whole of my vision—for it was no dream, and no nightmare—arose naturally from the circumstances of my position—from my ordinary bias of thought—and from the difficulty, to which I have alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory, for a long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the load itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my customary nightcap.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001549\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001549\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001550\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001550\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the time, to those of actual sepulture.

Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense. I mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom I speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet—of exemplifying by individual instance what has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief existence of Ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that in man’s very nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss. An anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that in general, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of mankind—that as a species we have in our possession the as yet unwrought elements of content—and that, even now, in the present darkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social condition, it is not impossible that man, the individual, under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001560\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001560\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001561\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001561\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully imbued, and thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was, in great measure, the result of preconcert. It is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which, now and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison would have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary success of his life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those of pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object to pen an essay on happiness. The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words. He admitted but four elementary principles, or more strictly, conditions of bliss. That which he considered chief was (strange to say!) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air. “The health,” he said, “attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.” He instanced the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to the tillers of the earth, the only people who, as a class, can be fairly considered happier than others. His second condition was the love of woman. His third, and most difficult of realization, was the contempt of ambition. His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other things being equal, the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the spirituality of this object.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001562\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001562\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001563\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001563\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune.

His possessions had been always ample; but on the attainment of his majority, it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom fail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their objects.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001564\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001564\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001565\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001565\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison’s coming of age, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison. This gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no immediate connections, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at the end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set aside this singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them abortive; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a legislative act finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations. This act, however, did not prevent young Ellison from entering into possession, on his twenty-first birthday, as the heir of his ancestor Seabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars.

The magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered all who thought on the topic. The possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things. With riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time—or busying himself with political intrigue—or aiming at ministerial power—or purchasing increase of nobility—or collecting large museums of virtu—or playing the munificent patron of letters, of science, of art—or endowing, and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. But for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir, these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a field. Recourse was had to figures, and these but sufficed to confound. It was seen that, even at three per cent., the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month; or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day; or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour; or six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to imagine. There were some who even conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself of at least one-half of his fortune, as of utterly superfluous opulence—enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance. To the nearest of these he did, in fact, abandon the very unusual wealth which was his own before the inheritance.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001568\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001568\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001569\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001569\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.

Some peculiarities, either in his early education, or in the nature of his intellect, had tinged with what is termed materialism all his ethical speculations; and it was this bias, perhaps, which led him to believe that the most advantageous at least, if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise, lies in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness.

Under other circumstances than those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have become a painter. Sculpture, although in its nature rigorously poetical was too limited in its extent and consequences, to have occupied, at any time, much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces in which the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it capable of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest, the truest, and most natural, if not altogether the most extensive province, had been unaccountably neglected. No definition had spoken of the landscape-gardener as of the poet; yet it seemed to my friend that the creation of the landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the most magnificent of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field for the display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty; the elements to enter into combination being, by a vast superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In the multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he recognised the most direct and energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness. And in the direction or concentration of this effort—or, more properly, in its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth—he perceived that he should be employing the best means—laboring to the greatest advantage—in the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny as poet, but of the august purposes for which the Deity had implanted the poetic sentiment in man.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001574\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001574\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001575\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001575\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.” In his explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward solving what has always seemed to me an enigma:—I mean the fact (which none but the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius may produce. No such paradises are to be found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of Claude. In the most enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect or an excess—many excesses and defects. While the component parts may defy, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of these parts will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no position can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth, from which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of offence in what is termed the “composition” of the landscape. And yet how unintelligible is this! In all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme. With her details we shrink from competition. Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley? The criticism which says, of sculpture or portraiture, that here nature is to be exalted or idealized rather than imitated, is in error. No pictorial or sculptural combinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach the living and breathing beauty. In landscape alone is the principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art. Having, I say, felt its truth here; for the feeling is no affectation or chimera. The mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of his art yields the artist. He not only believes, but positively knows, that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone constitute the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet been matured into expression. It remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them. Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of all his brethren. Let a “composition” be defective; let an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be submitted to every artist in the world; by each will its necessity be admitted. And even far more than this; in remedy of the defective composition, each insulated member of the fraternity would have suggested the identical emendation.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001576\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001576\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001577\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001577\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her susceptibility of improvement at this one point, was a mystery I had been unable to solve.

The force of this idea was much weakened, however, by the necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal and unadapted to any purpose. It was Ellison who suggested that they were prognostic of death. He thus explained:—Admit the earthly immortality of man to have been the first intention. We have then the primitive arrangement of the earth’s surface adapted to his blissful estate, as not existent but designed. The disturbances were the preparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001578\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001578\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001579\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001579\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Now,” said my friend, “what we regard as exaltation of the landscape may be really such, as respects only the moral or human point of view.

One seeks to recall the original beauty of the country, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery, cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land; detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size, proportion, and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature. The result of the natural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities—in the prevalence of a healthy harmony and order—than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. The artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify. It has a certain general relation to the various styles of building. There are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles; Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English style, which bears some relation to the domestic Gothic or English Elizabethan architecture. Whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of order and design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered balustrade, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days.

The original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced. Of course, every thing depends on the selection of a spot with capabilities. What is said about detecting and bringing into practice nice relations of size, proportion, and color, is one of those mere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought. The phrase quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no degree. That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius. The negative merit suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while that virtue which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be circumscribed in rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, can be apprehended in its results alone. Rule applies but to the merits of denial—to the excellencies which refrain. Beyond these, the critical art can but suggest. We may be instructed to build a “Cato,” but we are in vain told how to conceive a Parthenon or an “Inferno.” The thing done, however; the wonder accomplished; and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal. The sophists of the negative school who, through inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in applause. What, in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001586\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001586\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001587\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001587\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“The author’s observations on the artificial style,” continued Ellison, “are less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty. This is just; as also is the reference to the sense of human interest. The principle expressed is incontrovertible—but there may be something beyond it. There may be an object in keeping with the principle—an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed by individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human interest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual pecuniary resources, might, while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture, or, as our author expresses it, of interest, so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In the most rugged of wildernesses—in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature—there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is apparent to reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling. Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one step depressed—to be brought into something like harmony or consistency with the sense of human art—to form an intermedium between the two:—let us imagine, for example, a landscape whose combined vastness and definitiveness—whose united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness, shall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on the part of beings superior, yet akin to humanity—then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature—a nature which is not God, nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001588\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001588\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001589\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001589\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision such as this—in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the personal superintendence of his plans—in the unceasing object which these plans afforded—in the high spirituality of the object—in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel—in the perennial springs with which it gratified, without possibility of satiating, that one master passion of his soul, the thirst for beauty, above all, it was in the sympathy of a woman, not unwomanly, whose loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of Paradise, that Ellison thought to find, and found, exemption from the ordinary cares of humanity, with a far greater amount of positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Staël.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001590\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001590\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001591\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001591\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the marvels which my friend did actually accomplish.

The visitor left the city in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed between shores of a tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed innumerable sheep, their white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows. By degrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral care. This slowly became merged in a sense of retirement—this again in a consciousness of solitude. As the evening approached, the channel grew more narrow; the banks more and more precipitous; and these latter were clothed in rich, more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water increased in transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at no moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance than a furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an enchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage, a roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor—the keel balancing itself with admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which, by some accident having been turned upside down, floated in constant company with the substantial one, for the purpose of sustaining it. The channel now became a gorge—although the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ it merely because the language has no word which better represents the most striking—not the most distinctive—feature of the scene. The character of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of the shores; it was lost altogether in their other traits. The walls of the ravine (through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed) arose to an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet, and inclined so much toward each other as, in a great measure, to shut out the light of day; while the long plume-like moss which depended densely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole chasm an air of funereal gloom. The windings became more frequent and intricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves, so that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. He was, moreover, enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The thought of nature still remained, but her character seemed to have undergone modification, there was a weird symmetry, a thrilling uniformity, a wizard propriety in these her works. Not a dead branch—not a withered leaf—not a stray pebble—not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible. The crystal water welled up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with a sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001602\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001602\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001603\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001603\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the gloom deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel brought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a circular basin of very considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge. It was about two hundred yards in diameter, and girt in at all points but one—that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered—by hills equal in general height to the walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly different character. Their sides sloped from the water’s edge at an angle of some forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to summit—not a perceptible point escaping—in a drapery of the most gorgeous flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the sea of odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great depth, but so transparent was the water that the bottom, which seemed to consist of a thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles, was distinctly visible by glimpses—that is to say, whenever the eye could permit itself not to see, far down in the inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the hills. On these latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size. The impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness, warmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy, daintiness, voluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested dreams of a new race of fairies, laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and fastidious; but as the eye traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from its sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid the folds of overhanging cloud, it became, indeed, difficult not to fancy a panoramic cataract of rubies, sapphires, opals, and golden onyxes, rolling silently out of the sky.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001604\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001604\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001605\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001605\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The visitor, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun, which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon, but which now confronts him, and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless vista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001606\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001606\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001607\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001607\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far, and descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque devices in vivid scarlet, both within and without.

Here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a very gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture resembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of green which would bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald. This plateau varies in width from ten to three hundred yards; reaching from the river-bank to a wall, fifty feet high, which extends, in an infinity of curves, but following the general direction of the river, until lost in the distance to the westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, and has been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of the stream’s southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been suffered to remain. The chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and is profusely overhung and overspread with the ivy, the coral honeysuckle, the eglantine, and the clematis. The uniformity of the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height, growing singly or in small groups, both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall, but in close proximity to it; so that frequent limbs (of the black walnut especially) reach over and dip their pendent extremities into the water.

This gate is inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to cross the river at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen that the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive curve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a stream of considerable volume, diverging from the principal one, makes its way, with a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus hidden from sight. The canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate. Its ponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded. The boat glides between them, and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely begirt with purple mountains, whose bases are laved by a gleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit. Meantime the whole Paradise of Arnheim bursts upon the view. There is a gush of entrancing melody; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet odor;—there is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tall slender Eastern trees—bosky shrubberies—flocks of golden and crimson birds—lily-fringed lakes—meadows of violets, tulips, poppies, hyacinths, and tuberoses—long intertangled lines of silver streamlets—and, upspringing confusedly from amid all, a mass of semi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture sustaining itself by miracle in mid-air, glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred oriels, minarets, and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom handiwork, conjointly, of the Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii and of the Gnomes.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001616\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001616\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001617\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001617\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001618\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001618\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>LANDOR’S COTTAGE</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001619\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001619\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001620\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001620\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"center\\\">A Pendant to “The Domain of Arnheim”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001621\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001621\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001622\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001622\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>During A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of B——, where I had determined to stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone—strictly speaking—during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly warm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all things, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much about the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or even before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its appearance—although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. At all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me. I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease—Ponto taking charge of my gun—until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended to be paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The traces of light wheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon—the most aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in being open through the wood—if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of light trees—and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks—bore no resemblance to any road I had before seen. The tracks of which I speak were but faintly perceptible—having been impressed upon the firm, yet pleasantly moist surface of—what looked more like green Genoese velvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly—but grass such as we seldom see out of England—so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in color. Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route—not even a chip or dead twig. The stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully <i>placed</i>—not thrown—along the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere, luxuriantly, in the interspaces.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001623\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001623\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001624\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001624\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art undoubtedly—that did not surprise me—all roads, in the ordinary sense, are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might have been done here—with such natural “capabilities” (as they have it in the books on Landscape Gardening)—with very little labor and expense. No; it was not the amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, had superintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on the other.

It was most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tended southwardly, but with no very precise regularity. The widest portion was within eighty yards of the southern extreme. The slopes which encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at their northern face. Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was not more than fifty feet wide; but as the visitor proceeded southwardly from the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his left, declivities at once less high, less precipitous, and less rocky. All, in a word, sloped and softened to the south; and yet the whole vale was engirdled by eminences, more or less high, except at two points. One of these I have already spoken of. It lay considerably to the north of west, and was where the setting sun made its way, as I have before described, into the amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite embankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest point, so far as the eye could trace it. It seemed to lead up, up like a natural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests. The other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale. Here, generally, the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations, extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards. In the middle of this extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor of the valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every thing else, the scene softened and sloped to the south. To the north—on the craggy precipice—a few paces from the verge—up sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories, black walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed with occasional oak; and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially, spread far over the edge of the cliff. Proceeding southwardly, the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees, but less and less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw the gentler elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust—these again by the softer linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple—these yet again by still more graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone—an occasional silver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom of the valley itself—(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)—were to be seen three insulated trees. One was an elm of fine size and exquisite form: it stood guard over the southern gate of the vale. Another was a hickory, much larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although both were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the northwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws of the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre. About thirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley, and beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen, unless, perhaps, among the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a triple-stemmed tulip-tree—the Liriodendron Tulipiferum—one of the natural order of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parent at about three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and gradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where the largest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation of about eighty feet. The whole height of the principal division was one hundred and twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy, vivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree. In the present instance they were fully eight inches wide; but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive, closely congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips! Only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would convey. And then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated columnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the ground. The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of other trees scarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less majestic, filled the valley with more than Arabian perfumes.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001637\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001637\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001638\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001638\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as that I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick, velvety, and miraculously green.

From the one to the northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the tree, it passed on a little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree some twenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley. At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went—until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale. This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part. No crystal could be clearer than its waters. Its bottom, which could be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. Its banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded, rather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above it, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced, it was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, and some other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish. It was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air. A light birch canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house—arose from the lake not far from its northern shore—to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light-looking and yet very primitive bridge. It was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulip wood. This was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all oscillation. From the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards, finally passed through the “depression” (already described) in the middle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001641\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001641\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001642\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001642\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The lake was deep—at some points thirty feet—but the rivulet seldom exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight.

These latter roofs, of course, needed no support; but as they had the air of needing it, slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone. The roof of the northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof. Between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and red:—a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. Over the gables the roofs also projected very much:—in the main building about four feet to the east and two to the west. The principal door was not exactly in the main division, being a little to the east—while the two windows were to the west. These latter did not extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than usual—they had single shutters like doors—the panes were of lozenge form, but quite large. The door itself had its upper half of glass, also in lozenge panes—a movable shutter secured it at night. The door to the west wing was in its gable, and quite simple—a single window looked out to the south.

One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or rather voluptuousness; another was a “carnival piece,” spirited beyond compare; the third was a Greek female head—a face so divinely beautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, never before arrested my attention.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001687\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001687\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001688\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001688\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather “settee;” its material was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstriped with green; the seat of cane.

I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I would have them allow—what they cannot refrain from allowing—that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before—certainly, never thus fell.

Of this church the principal of our school was pastor.

I had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance. I looked;—and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were these—these the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not. What was there about them to confound me in this manner? I gazed;—while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared—assuredly not thus—in the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the same contour of person! the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation? Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old academy, never to enter them again.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001750\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001750\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001751\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001751\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found myself a student at Eton.

The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He said that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001754\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001754\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001755\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001755\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me.

The <i>parvenu</i>, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether account. In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating—he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. The result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils: in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say to my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001770\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001770\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001771\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001771\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say.

In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001776\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001776\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001777\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001777\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it was received.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001778\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001778\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001779\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001779\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Mr. Wilson,” said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, “Mr. Wilson, this is your property.” (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching the scene of play.) “I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther evidence of your skill.

The singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself.

And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!—would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges creaked)—I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights—every night just at midnight—but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night.

His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself—“It is nothing but the wind in the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the floor,” or “It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim.

It is more than probable that I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate idea of that nervous <i>intensity of interest</i> with which, in my case, the powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried themselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001864\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001864\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001865\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001865\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to some frivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a book; to become absorbed, for the better part of a summer’s day, in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor; to lose myself, for an entire night, in watching the steady flame of a lamp, or the embers of a fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower; to repeat, monotonously, some common word, until the sound, by dint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind; to lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in: such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled, but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001866\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001866\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001867\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001867\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Yet let me not be misapprehended.

It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme condition, or exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and essentially distinct and different. In the one instance, the dreamer, or enthusiast, being interested by an object usually <i>not</i> frivolous, imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day-dream <i>often replete with luxury</i>, he finds the <i>incitamentum</i>, or first cause of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the primary object was <i>invariably frivolous</i>, although assuming, through the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance. Few deductions, if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre. The meditations were <i>never</i> pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the first cause, so far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease.

In the multiplied objects of the external world I had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzied desire. All other matters and all different interests became absorbed in their single contemplation. They—they alone were present to the mental eye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of my mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every attitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their peculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon the alteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them in imagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when unassisted by the lips, a capability of moral expression. Of Mademoiselle Salle it has been well said, “<i>Que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments</i>,” and of Berenice I more seriously believed <i>que toutes ses dents etaient des idées</i>. <i>Des idées!</i>—ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me! <i>Des idées!</i>—ah, <i>therefore</i> it was that I coveted them so madly!

She had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning, and now, at the closing in of the night, the grave was ready for its tenant, and all the preparations for the burial were completed.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001884\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001884\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001885\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001885\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone. It seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream. I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware, that since the setting of the sun, Berenice had been interred. But of that dreary period which intervened I had no positive, at least no definite comprehension. Yet its memory was replete with horror—horror more horrible from being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity. It was a fearful page in the record my existence, written all over with dim, and hideous, and unintelligible recollections. I strived to decypher them, but in vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a departed sound, the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing in my ears.

It was one evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each other’s embrace, beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked down within the water of the River of Silence at our images therein. We spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the God Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for centuries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A change fell upon all things. Strange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before. The tints of the green carpet deepened; and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And life arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us. The golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of Æolus—sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too, a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, as if forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001911\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001911\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001912\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001912\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers.

She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses, transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw myself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of Earth—that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of Him and of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise, involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it made easy to her the bed of her death. And she said to me, not many days afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when departed, and, if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or filling the air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels. And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001917\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001917\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001918\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001918\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Thus far I have faithfully said.

And the golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river never again.

But as yet my soul had proved true to its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still given me in the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations they ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible temptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once—at whose footstool I bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject worship of love. What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?—Oh, bright was the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had room for none other. Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as I looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought only of them—and of her.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001925\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001925\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001926\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001926\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I wedded—nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness was not visited upon me.

The traveller, having passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the gates of the city, proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles to the road across the desert to Suez, and after having travelled some ten miles up a low barren valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as if the tide had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills, which has for some distance run parallel to his path. The scene now presented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate. A mass of fragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when struck by his horse’s hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to extend itself for miles and miles around him, in the form of a decayed and prostrate forest. The wood is of a dark brown hue, but retains its form in perfection, the pieces being from one to fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot to three feet in thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eye can reach, that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way through amongst them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or Ireland, it might pass without remark for some enormous drained bog, on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots and rudiments of the branches are, in many cases, nearly perfect, and in some the worm-holes eaten under the bark are readily recognizable. The most delicate of the sap vessels, and all the finer portions of the centre of the wood, are perfectly entire, and bear to be examined with the strongest magnifiers. The whole are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch glass and are capable of receiving the highest polish.— <i>Asiatic Magazine</i>.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001942\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001942\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001943\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001943\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>(*3) The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001944\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001944\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001945\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001945\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>(*4) In Iceland, 1783.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001946\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001946\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001947\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000001947\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>(*5) “During the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind produced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is more than fifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find their way by groping.

The tubular part is internally beset with stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains the pistil, which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together with the surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter than the germen, cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the flower stands always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without some additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan down to the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has furnished in this case, is that of the <i>Tiputa Pennicornis</i>, a small insect, which entering the tube of the corrolla in quest of honey, descends to the bottom, and rummages about till it becomes quite covered with pollen; but not being able to force its way out again, owing to the downward position of the hairs, which converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap, and being somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes backwards and forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly traversing the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its impregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop, and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube, effecting an easy passage for the escape of the insect.”—<i>Rev.

The name of the fortunate heir was Thelluson.

The germ, and in fact, the commencement of the present paper was published many years ago—previous to the issue of the first number of Sue’s admirable <i>Juif Errant</i>, which may possibly have been suggested to him by Muskau’s account.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002030\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002030\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002031\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002031\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3>Notes—Berenice</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002032\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002032\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002033\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002033\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>(*1) For as Jove, during the winter season, gives twice seven days of warmth, men have called this element and temperate time the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon—<i>Simonides</i></p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002034\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002034\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002035\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002035\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c6\\\">*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, VOL. 2 ***</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002036\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002036\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c12\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002037\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002037\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c12\\\"><div class=\\\"c2\\\">Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002038\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002038\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c12\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002039\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/e8801f1d959ec96b/text/000002039\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-0371ff twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-05227b twpub-e8801f1d959ec96b-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c12\\\"><div class=\\\"c2\\\">Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
