Nay, but even so he saved not his company, though he desired it sore. For through the blindness of their own hearts they perished, fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion: but the god took from them their day of returning. Of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof, declare thou even unto us.<br>\\n    Now all the rest, as many as fled from sheer destruction, were at home, and had escaped both war and sea, but Odysseus only, craving for his wife and for his homeward path, the lady nymph Calypso held, that fair goddess, in her hollow caves, longing to have him for her lord. But when now the year had come in the courses of the seasons, wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca, not even there was he quit of labours, not even among his own; but all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon, who raged continually against godlike Odysseus, till he came to his own country. Howbeit Poseidon had now departed for the distant Ethiopians, the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain, the uttermost of men, abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where he rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams, there he made merry sitting at the feast, but the other gods were gathered in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the father of men and gods began to speak, for he bethought him in his heart of noble Aegisthus, whom the son of Agamemnon, far-famed Orestes, slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among the Immortals:<br>\\n    ‘Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own hearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to him the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and killed her lord on his return, and that with sheer doom before his eyes, since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen-sighted, the slayer of Argos, that he should neither kill the man, nor woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes, so soon as he shall come to man’s estate and long for his own country. So spake Hermes, yet he prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus, for all his good will; but now hath he paid one price for all.’<br>\\n    And the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, answered him, saying: ‘O father, our father Cronides, throned in the highest; that man assuredly lies in a death that is his due; so perish likewise all who work such deeds! But my heart is rent for wise Odysseus, the hapless one, who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea, a woodland isle, and therein a goddess hath her habitation, the daughter of the wizard Atlas, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow: and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to forgetfulness of Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but the smoke leap upwards from his own land, hath a desire to die. As for thee, thine heart regardeth it not at all, Olympian! What! Did not Odysseus by the ships of the Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him, O Zeus?’</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000038\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000038\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000039\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000039\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The “Odyssey” (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from the “Iliad”; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type, with marginal references to the “Iliad,” and had marked them to this end in my MS.

I have given the British Museum a copy of the “Odyssey” with the Iliadic passages underlined and referred to in MS.; I have also given an “Iliad” marked with all the Odyssean passages, and their references; but copies of both the “Iliad” and “Odyssey” so marked ought to be within easy reach of all students.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000040\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000040\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000041\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000041\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Any one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen round the “Iliad” since Wolf’s time, without keeping it well before his reader’s mind that the “Odyssey” was demonstrably written from one single neighbourhood, and hence (even though nothing else pointed to this conclusion) presumably by one person only—that it was written certainly before 750, and in all probability before 1000 B.C.—that the writer of this very early poem was demonstrably familiar with the “Iliad” as we now have it, borrowing as freely from those books whose genuineness has been most impugned, as from those which are admitted to be by Homer—any one who fails to keep these points before his readers, is hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand, who will mark his “Iliad” and his “Odyssey” from the copies in the British Museum above referred to, and who will draw the only inference that common sense can draw from the presence of so many identical passages in both poems, will, I believe, find no difficulty in assigning their proper value to a large number of books here and on the Continent that at present enjoy considerable reputations. Furthermore, and this perhaps is an advantage better worth securing, he will find that many puzzles of the “Odyssey” cease to puzzle him on the discovery that they arise from over-saturation with the “Iliad.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000042\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000042\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000043\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000043\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Other difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of the poem in the writer’s mind is understood.

This poem includes the Phaeacian episode, and the account of Ulysses’ adventures as told by himself in Books ix.-xii.

It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return, and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning—lay your case before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother’s mind is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing Orestes’ praises for having killed his father’s murderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said to you.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000129\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000129\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000130\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000130\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Sir,” answered Telemachus, “it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all you tell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself.

He stood in the middle of the assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning to Aegyptius, “Sir,” said he, “it is I, as you will shortly learn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My grievance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and was like a father to every one of you; the second is much more serious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius, asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my father’s house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and leave me singlehanded<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002332\\\"><sup>[18]</sup></$link>—unless it be that my brave father Ulysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors.

Nine long years did we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us; during all this time there was no one who could compare with your father in subtlety—if indeed you are his son—I can hardly believe my eyes—and you talk just like him too—no one would say that people of such different ages could speak so much alike.

When we got to Sunium, which is the point of Athens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaus’ ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to press forward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but after Phaestus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas to Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed the murderer of his father.

I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and the Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, and the sheep lamb down three times a year.

I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one of all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive or dead.

So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove came to hear of it before so very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts. And now you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found the poor creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal, so that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing; therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men who can take him.

So she gave him a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it.

He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it.

We must see that he comes to no harm while on his homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take the luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who has come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods are departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made themselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other of them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of kin to the gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.”<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002520\\\"><sup>[62]</sup></$link></p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000655\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000655\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000656\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000656\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then Ulysses said: “Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into your head.

So he at once said, “Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000696\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000696\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000697\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000697\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>With these words he led the way, and the others followed after.

It was so huge that we could only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large burden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do, and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of them should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the monster’s eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and drove his flocks into the cave—this time driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all this work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them.

When the wood, green though it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam into the monster’s eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship’s plank with an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper it—for it is this that gives strength to the iron—and it makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops’ eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with him.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000839\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000839\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000840\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000840\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that you make such a noise, breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able to sleep?

Climbing to the top of a high look-out I espied the smoke of Circe’s house rising upwards amid a dense forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000904\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000904\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000905\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000905\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet of the noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much too big for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. ‘Look here my friends,’ said I, ‘we are not going to die so much before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.’ On this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a splendid fellow.

They had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little water from time to time while the inward meats were being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001154\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001154\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001155\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001155\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the ship and to the sea shore.

It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but as soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis where the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to get inside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were.

When, however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on the field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw you can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but was the first to leap forward and spear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would bring up children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows—things that most men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another another, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance, and much more was allotted to me later on.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001284\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001284\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001285\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001285\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many perished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to Troy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our doing so.

The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood up to give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much pleased. “I hope, Eumaeus,” said he, “that Jove will be as well disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you are showing to an outcast like myself.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001308\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001308\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001309\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001309\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “Eat, my good fellow, and enjoy your supper, such as it is.

Her father and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus, who has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are—they always want to do the best they can for the man who marries them, and never give another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their father either when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own.

But as Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva in the ship’s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was descended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep; he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos, where it was ordained that he should reign over much people. There he married, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates and Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman’s gifts. His sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was father to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus for his beauty’s sake, that he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead.

The sun was now set, and darkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the woman and she fell heavily down into the ship’s hold as though she were a sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone.

Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all the armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and Minerva will then soon quiet these people. There is also another matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that Ulysses is within the house—neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even Penelope herself.

A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with the pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all the Greeks cheered him—if he is still such, and were to come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your question, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much will I tell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.’ This was what Menelaus told me, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001553\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001553\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001554\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001554\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>With these words he moved the heart of Penelope.

They are excellent also at fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do you look after things here. Take care of my father and mother as at present, and even more so during my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave this your present home.’ This is what he said and now it is all coming true.

When men are courting a woman who they think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and when they are each trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen and sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and they make her magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people’s property without paying for it.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001712\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001712\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001713\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001713\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying to get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair words which he knew she did not mean.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001714\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001714\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001715\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001715\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then Antinous said, “Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many presents as you please from any one who will give them to you; it is not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business nor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among us whoever he may be.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001716\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001716\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001717\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001717\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his servant to bring his present.

If he were to return and look after my affairs I should be both more respected and should show a better presence to the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our islands—Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca itself, are wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time broken-hearted about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to them, ‘Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded—till I have finished making a pall for the hero Laertes, to be ready against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.’ This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I used to keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for three years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was now in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished, those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me, so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is now old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to look after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are and where you come from—for you must have had father and mother of some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001777\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001777\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001778\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001778\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then Ulysses answered, “Madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in asking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs me: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as I have, and suffered as much among as many peoples.

As soon as he got there he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with barley meal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their heart’s content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one’s feet on land.

Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect. Ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this there was a device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape.<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002894\\\"><sup>[153]</sup></$link> As for the shirt that he wore next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld it.

I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour.

A woman who has loved her husband and borne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even though he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a god. Still, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell you. I will hide nothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god’s cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all this, and he swore to me—making drink-offerings in his house as he did so—that the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would take Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first, for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove’s mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001787\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001787\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001788\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001788\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“May it be even so,” answered Penelope; “if your words come true you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be.

They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came to a mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it, nor could the sun’s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men’s feet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him, so he rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar, Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses’ wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent him back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, his father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all about it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with Autolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001805\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001805\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001806\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001806\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>As soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well hold of it, she recognised it and dropped the foot at once.

As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so does my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard to public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me to go with the best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still young, and unable to understand, he would not hear of my leaving my husband’s house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his property. Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for me if you can.

Presently he soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard; whereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so piteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice, and told me to leave off crying. ‘Be of good courage,’ he said, ‘daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a vision of good omen that shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who will bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.’ On this I woke, and when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001817\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001817\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001818\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001818\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“This dream, Madam,” replied Ulysses, “can admit but of one interpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled?

The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Juno taught them to excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an imposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment; but one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only, and without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was.

My position is intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put myself under the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return, and send all these suitors flying out of the house.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001866\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001866\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001867\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001867\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Stockman,” answered Ulysses, “you seem to be a very well-disposed person, and I can see that you are a man of sense.

She went upstairs and got the store-room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store-room at the end of the house, where her husband’s treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in Lacedaemon—Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with one another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had gone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were the death of him in the end, for when he went to the house of Jove’s son, mighty Hercules, who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven’s vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set before Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death had been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although they never visited at one another’s houses, for Jove’s son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001911\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001911\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001912\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001912\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as to get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the doors.

No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those who drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the Lapithae. When the wine had got into his head, he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime, bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you will never get away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger than yourself.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001963\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001963\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001964\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001964\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Penelope then spoke to him. “Antinous,” said she, “it is not right that you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house.

There was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter’s tools well and skilfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into a bed-prop.

He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.’ This is what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight.

He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string the bow—nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the hands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with our blood.

Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once when I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I liked better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it.

Eryx, and that the Aegadean islands which are so striking when seen thence did duty with her for the Ionian islands—Marettimo, the highest and most westerly of the group, standing for Ithaca. When seen from the top of Mt. Eryx Marettimo shows as it should do according to “Od.” ix. 25, 26, “on the horizon, all highest up in the sea towards the West,” while the other islands lie “some way off it to the East.” As we descend to Trapani, Marettimo appears to sink on to the top of the island of Levanzo, behind which it disappears. My friend, the late Signor E.

In the present case the line bracketed is the very last which a full-grown male editor would be likely to interpolate. It is safer to infer that the writer, a young woman, not knowing or caring at which end of the ship the rudder should be, determined to make sure by placing it at both ends, which we shall find she presently does by repeating it (line 340) at the stern of the ship. As for the two rocks thrown, the first I take to be the Asinelli, see map facing p. 80. The second I see as the two contiguous islands of the Formiche, which are treated as one, see map facing p. 108. The Asinelli is an island shaped like a boat, and pointing to the island of Favognana. I think the authoress’s compatriots, who probably did not like her much better that she did them, jeered at the absurdity of Ulysses’ conduct, and saw the Asinelli or “donkeys,” not as the rock thrown by Polyphemus, but as the boat itself containing Ulysses and his men.]</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002599\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002599\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002600\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002600\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p><a></a></p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002601\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002601\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002602\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002602\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000000868\\\">[82]</$link><br>\\n[ This line exists in the text here but not in the corresponding passage xii. 141.

The island itself, as apart from its inhabitants, was quite normal. There is no indication of its moving during the month that Ulysses stayed with Aeolus, and on his return from his unfortunate voyage, he seems to have found it in the same place. The πλωτῇ in fact should no more be pressed than θοῇσι as applied to islands, “Odyssey” xv. 299—where they are called “flying” because the ship would fly past them.

I have been unable to find grounds for asserting that B.C. 1000 there was any commerce between the Mediterranean and the “Far North,” but I shall be very ready to learn if Mr. Lang will enlighten me.

From this point of vantage they spear sword-fish. When I saw men thus employed I could hardly doubt that the writer of the “Odyssey” had seen others like them, and had them in her mind when describing the binding of Ulysses. I have therefore with some diffidence ventured to depart from the received translation of ἰστοπέδη (cf. Alcaeus frag. 18, where, however, it is very hard to say what ἰστοπέδαν means). In Sophocles’ Lexicon I find a reference to Chrysostom (l, 242, A. Ed. Benedictine Paris 1834-1839) for the word ἰστοπόδη, which is probably the same as ἰστοπέδη, but I have looked for the passage in vain.]</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002671\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002671\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002672\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002672\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p><a></a></p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002673\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002673\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002674\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002674\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-769d3732d4c38307-4b6aff twpub-769d3732d4c38307-39c75b twpub-769d3732d4c38307-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000001107\\\">[100]</$link><br>\\n[ The writer is at fault here and tries to put it off on Circe. When Ulysses comes to take the route prescribed by Circe, he ought to pass either the Wanderers or some other difficulty of which we are not told, but he does not do so. The Planctae, or Wanderers, merge into Scylla and Charybdis, and the alternative between them and something untold merges into the alternative whether Ulysses had better choose Scylla or Charybdis. Yet from line 260, it seems we are to consider the Wanderers as having been passed by Ulysses; this appears even more plainly from xxiii. 327, in which Ulysses expressly mentions the Wandering rocks as having been between the Sirens and Scylla and Charybdis. The writer, however, is evidently unaware that she does not quite understand her own story; her difficulty was perhaps due to the fact that though Trapanese sailors had given her a fair idea as to where all her other localities really were, no one in those days more than in our own could localise the Planctae, which in fact, as Buttmann has argued, were derived not from any particular spot, but from sailors’ tales about the difficulties of navigating the group of the Aeolian islands as a whole (see note on “Od.” x. 3). Still the matter of the poor doves caught her fancy, so she would not forgo them. The whirlwinds of fire and the smoke that hangs on Scylla suggests allusion to Stromboli and perhaps even Etna. Scylla is on the Italian side, and therefore may be said to look West.

The writer is evidently still fluctuating between Euryclea and Eurynome as the name for the old nurse. She probably originally meant to call her Euryclea, but finding it not immediately easy to make Euryclea scan in xvii. 495, she hastily called her Eurynome, intending either to alter this name later or to change the earlier Euryclea’s into Eurynome. She then drifted in to Eurynome as convenience further directed, still nevertheless hankering after Euryclea, till at last she found that the path of least resistance would lie in the direction of making Eurynome and Euryclea two persons. Therefore in xxiii. 289-292 both Eurynome and “the nurse” (who can be none other than Euryclea) come on together.

425, etc. from which it appears that there was a tower in the outer court, and that Telemachus used to sleep in it. The ὀρσοθύρα I take to be a door, or trap door, leading on to the roof above Telemachus’s bed room, which we are told was in a place that could be seen from all round—or it might be simply a window in Telemachus’s room looking out into the street. From the top of the tower the outer world was to be told what was going on, but people could not get in by the ὀρσοθύρα: they would have to come in by the main entrance, and Melanthius explains that the mouth of the narrow passage (which was in the lands of Ulysses and his friends) commanded the only entrance by which help could come, so that there would be nothing gained by raising an alarm.<br>\\n    As for the ῥῶγες of line 143, no commentator ancient or modern has been able to say what was intended—but whatever they were, Melanthius could never carry twelve shields, twelve helmets, and twelve spears. Moreover, where he could go the others could go also. If a dozen suitors had followed Melanthius into the house they could have attacked Ulysses in the rear, in which case, unless Minerva had intervened promptly, the “Odyssey” would have had a different ending. But throughout the scene we are in a region of extravagance rather than of true fiction—it cannot be taken seriously by any but the very serious, until we come to the episode of Phemius and Medon, where the writer begins to be at home again.]</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/769d3732d4c38307/text/000002973\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\":
