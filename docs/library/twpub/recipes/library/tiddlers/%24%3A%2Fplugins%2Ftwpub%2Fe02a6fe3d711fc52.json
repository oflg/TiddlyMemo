In the first place she had been out hunting all night. Then, before she could reach home, Bowser the Hound had found her tracks and started to follow them. Of course, it wouldn't have done to go home then. It wouldn't have done at all. Bowser would have followed her straight there and so found out where she lived. So she had led Bowser far away across the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest and finally played one of her smart tricks which had so mixed her tracks that Bowser could no longer follow them. While he had sniffed and snuffed and snuffed and sniffed with that wonderful nose of his, trying to find out where she had gone, Old Granny Fox had trotted straight to the sunny knoll and there curled up to rest.

1.E below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation”\\n<br> or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the\\n<br>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an\\n<br>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are\\n<br>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from\\n<br>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative\\n<br>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg\\n<br>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by\\n<br>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of\\n<br>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with\\n<br>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by\\n<br>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\\n<br>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in\\n<br>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check\\n<br>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement\\n<br>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or\\n<br>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning\\n<br>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United\\n<br>States.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate\\n<br>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently\\n<br>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the\\n<br>phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project\\n<br>Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,\\n<br>copied or distributed:\\n<br>\\n<br>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\\n<br>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or\\n<br>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\\n<br>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived\\n<br>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is\\n<br>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied\\n<br>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees\\n<br>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work\\n<br>with the phrase “Project Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the\\n<br>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1\\n<br>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or\\n<br>1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted\\n<br>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution\\n<br>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional\\n<br>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked\\n<br>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the\\n<br>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this\\n<br>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this\\n<br>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without\\n<br>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with\\n<br>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,\\n<br>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any\\n<br>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or\\n<br>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than\\n<br>“Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version\\n<br>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),\\n<br>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a\\n<br>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon\\n<br>request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other\\n<br>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,\\n<br>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works\\n<br>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing\\n<br>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided\\n<br>that\\n<br>\\n<br>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from\\n<br>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method\\n<br>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is\\n<br>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he\\n<br>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the\\n<br>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments\\n<br>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you\\n<br>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax\\n<br>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and\\n<br>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the\\n<br>     address specified in Section 4, “Information about donations to\\n<br>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.”\\n<br>\\n<br>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies\\n<br>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\\n<br>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>     License.  You must require such a user to return or\\n<br>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium\\n<br>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of\\n<br>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.\\n<br>\\n<br>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any\\n<br>     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the\\n<br>     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days\\n<br>     of receipt of the work.\\n<br>\\n<br>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free\\n<br>     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set\\n<br>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from\\n<br>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael\\n<br>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the\\n<br>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\\n<br>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\\n<br>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\n<br>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\\n<br>“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\\n<br>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\\n<br>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\\n<br>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\\n<br>your equipment.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right\\n<br>of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\n<br>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\n<br>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\\n<br>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\\n<br>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\\n<br>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\\n<br>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\\n<br>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\\n<br>DAMAGE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\\n<br>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\\n<br>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\\n<br>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\\n<br>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\\n<br>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\\n<br>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\\n<br>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\\n<br>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\\n<br>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\\n<br>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\\n<br>opportunities to fix the problem.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\\n<br>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER\\n<br>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\\n<br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\\n<br>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\\n<br>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\\n<br>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\\n<br>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\\n<br>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\\n<br>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\n<br>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\n<br>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\\n<br>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\\n<br>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\\n<br>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\\n<br>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\\n<br>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\n<br>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\n<br>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\n<br>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\n<br>people in all walks of life.\\n<br>\\n<br>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\n<br>assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\n<br>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\n<br>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\n<br>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\n<br>To learn more

Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\n<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\n<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\n<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n<br>\\n<br>     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>This Web site includes information about
