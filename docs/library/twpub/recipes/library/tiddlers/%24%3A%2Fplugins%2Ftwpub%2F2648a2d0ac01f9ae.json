There had been a crowd following all the way, owing to the exuberance of Marija Berczynskas. The occasion rested heavily upon Marija’s broad shoulders—it was her task to see that all things went in due form, and after the best home traditions; and, flying wildly hither and thither, bowling every one out of the way, and scolding and exhorting all day with her tremendous voice, Marija was too eager to see that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself. She had left the church last of all, and, desiring to arrive first at the hall, had issued orders to the coachman to drive faster. When that personage had developed a will of his own in the matter, Marija had flung up the window of the carriage, and, leaning out, proceeded to tell him her opinion of him, first in Lithuanian, which he did not understand, and then in Polish, which he did. Having the advantage of her in altitude, the driver had stood his ground and even ventured to attempt to speak; and the result had been a furious altercation, which, continuing all the way down Ashland Avenue, had added a new swarm of urchins to the cortege at each side street for half a mile.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000021\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000021\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000022\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000022\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This was unfortunate, for already there was a throng before the door.

There was no time during the festivities which ensued when there were not groups of onlookers in the doorways and the corners; and if any one of these onlookers came sufficiently close, or looked sufficiently hungry, a chair was offered him, and he was invited to the feast. It was one of the laws of the <i>veselija</i> that no one goes hungry; and, while a rule made in the forests of Lithuania is hard to apply in the stockyards district of Chicago, with its quarter of a million inhabitants, still they did their best, and the children who ran in from the street, and even the dogs, went out again happier. A charming informality was one of the characteristics of this celebration. The men wore their hats, or, if they wished, they took them off, and their coats with them; they ate when and where they pleased, and moved as often as they pleased. There were to be speeches and singing, but no one had to listen who did not care to; if he wished, meantime, to speak or sing himself, he was perfectly free. The resulting medley of sound distracted no one, save possibly alone the babies, of which there were present a number equal to the total possessed by all the guests invited. There was no other place for the babies to be, and so part of the preparations for the evening consisted of a collection of cribs and carriages in one corner. In these the babies slept, three or four together, or wakened together, as the case might be. Those who were still older, and could reach the tables, marched about munching contentedly at meat bones and bologna sausages.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000033\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000033\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000034\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000034\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The room is about thirty feet square, with whitewashed walls, bare save for a calendar, a picture of a race horse, and a family tree in a gilded frame.

A pair of military trousers, light blue with a yellow stripe, serve to give that suggestion of authority proper to the leader of a band.

Some of the people are eating, some are laughing and talking—but you will make a great mistake if you think there is one of them who does not hear him. His notes are never true, and his fiddle buzzes on the low ones and squeaks and scratches on the high; but these things they heed no more than they heed the dirt and noise and squalor about them—it is out of this material that they have to build their lives, with it that they have to utter their souls. And this is their utterance; merry and boisterous, or mournful and wailing, or passionate and rebellious, this music is their music, music of home. It stretches out its arms to them, they have only to give themselves up. Chicago and its saloons and its slums fade away—there are green meadows and sunlit rivers, mighty forests and snow-clad hills. They behold home landscapes and childhood scenes returning; old loves and friendships begin to waken, old joys and griefs to laugh and weep. Some fall back and close their eyes, some beat upon the table. Now and then one leaps up with a cry and calls for this song or that; and then the fire leaps brighter in Tamoszius’ eyes, and he flings up his fiddle and shouts to his companions, and away they go in mad career. The company takes up the choruses, and men and women cry out like all possessed; some leap to their feet and stamp upon the floor, lifting their glasses and pledging each other. Before long it occurs to some one to demand an old wedding song, which celebrates the beauty of the bride and the joys of love. In the excitement of this masterpiece Tamoszius Kuszleika begins to edge in between the tables, making his way toward the head, where sits the bride. There is not a foot of space between the chairs of the guests, and Tamoszius is so short that he pokes them with his bow whenever he reaches over for the low notes; but still he presses in, and insists relentlessly that his companions must follow. During their progress, needless to say, the sounds of the cello are pretty well extinguished; but at last the three are at the head, and Tamoszius takes his station at the right hand of the bride and begins to pour out his soul in melting strains.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000053\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000053\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000054\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000054\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Little Ona is too excited to eat.

His companion follows, but with his eyes open, watching where he treads, so to speak; and finally Valentinavyczia, after waiting for a little and beating with his foot to get the time, casts up his eyes to the ceiling and begins to saw—“Broom! broom! broom!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000065\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000065\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000066\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000066\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The company pairs off quickly, and the whole room is soon in motion. Apparently nobody knows how to waltz, but that is nothing of any consequence—there is music, and they dance, each as he pleases, just as before they sang. Most of them prefer the “two-step,” especially the young, with whom it is the fashion. The older people have dances from home, strange and complicated steps which they execute with grave solemnity. Some do not dance anything at all, but simply hold each other’s hands and allow the undisciplined joy of motion to express itself with their feet. Among these are Jokubas Szedvilas and his wife, Lucija, who together keep the delicatessen store, and consume nearly as much as they sell; they are too fat to dance, but they stand in the middle of the floor, holding each other fast in their arms, rocking slowly from side to side and grinning seraphically, a picture of toothless and perspiring ecstasy.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000067\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000067\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000068\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000068\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Of these older people many wear clothing reminiscent in some detail of home—an embroidered waistcoat or stomacher, or a gaily colored handkerchief, or a coat with large cuffs and fancy buttons. All these things are carefully avoided by the young, most of whom have learned to speak English and to affect the latest style of clothing. The girls wear ready-made dresses or shirt waists, and some of them look quite pretty. Some of the young men you would take to be Americans, of the type of clerks, but for the fact that they wear their hats in the room. Each of these younger couples affects a style of its own in dancing. Some hold each other tightly, some at a cautious distance. Some hold their hands out stiffly, some drop them loosely at their sides. Some dance springily, some glide softly, some move with grave dignity. There are boisterous couples, who tear wildly about the room, knocking every one out of their way. There are nervous couples, whom these frighten, and who cry, “Nusfok! Kas yra?” at them as they pass. Each couple is paired for the evening—you will never see them change about. There is Alena Jasaityte, for instance, who has danced unending hours with Juozas Raczius, to whom she is engaged. Alena is the beauty of the evening, and she would be really beautiful if she were not so proud. She wears a white shirtwaist, which represents, perhaps, half a week’s labor painting cans. She holds her skirt with her hand as she dances, with stately precision, after the manner of the <i>grandes dames</i>. Juozas is driving one of Durham’s wagons, and is making big wages. He affects a “tough” aspect, wearing his hat on one side and keeping a cigarette in his mouth all the evening. Then there is Jadvyga Marcinkus, who is also beautiful, but humble. Jadvyga likewise paints cans, but then she has an invalid mother and three little sisters to support by it, and so she does not spend her wages for shirtwaists. Jadvyga is small and delicate, with jet-black eyes and hair, the latter twisted into a little knot and tied on the top of her head. She wears an old white dress which she has made herself and worn to parties for the past five years; it is high-waisted—almost under her arms, and not very becoming,—but that does not trouble Jadvyga, who is dancing with her Mikolas. She is small, while he is big and powerful; she nestles in his arms as if she would hide herself from view, and leans her head upon his shoulder. He in turn has clasped his arms tightly around her, as if he would carry her away; and so she dances, and will dance the entire evening, and would dance forever, in ecstasy of bliss. You would smile, perhaps, to see them—but you would not smile if you knew all the story. This is the fifth year, now, that Jadvyga has been engaged to Mikolas, and her heart is sick. They would have been married in the beginning, only Mikolas has a father who is drunk all day, and he is the only other man in a large family. Even so they might have managed it (for Mikolas is a skilled man) but for cruel accidents which have almost taken the heart out of them. He is a beef-boner, and that is a dangerous trade, especially when you are on piecework and trying to earn a bride. Your hands are slippery, and your knife is slippery, and you are toiling like mad, when somebody happens to speak to you, or you strike a bone. Then your hand slips up on the blade, and there is a fearful gash. And that would not be so bad, only for the deadly contagion. The cut may heal, but you never can tell. Twice now; within the last three years, Mikolas has been lying at home with blood poisoning—once for three months and once for nearly seven. The last time, too, he lost his job, and that meant six weeks more of standing at the doors of the packing houses, at six o’clock on bitter winter mornings, with a foot of snow on the ground and more in the air. There are learned people who can tell you out of the statistics that beef-boners make forty cents an hour, but, perhaps, these people have never looked into a beef-boner’s hands.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000069\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000069\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000070\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000070\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>When Tamoszius and his companions stop for a rest, as perforce they must, now and then, the dancers halt where they are and wait patiently. They never seem to tire; and there is no place for them to sit down if they did. It is only for a minute, anyway, for the leader starts up again, in spite of all the protests of the other two. This time it is another sort of a dance, a Lithuanian dance. Those who prefer to, go on with the two-step, but the majority go through an intricate series of motions, resembling more fancy skating than a dance. The climax of it is a furious <i>prestissimo</i>, at which the couples seize hands and begin a mad whirling. This is quite irresistible, and every one in the room joins in, until the place becomes a maze of flying skirts and bodies quite dazzling to look upon. But the sight of sights at this moment is Tamoszius Kuszleika. The old fiddle squeaks and shrieks in protest, but Tamoszius has no mercy. The sweat starts out on his forehead, and he bends over like a cyclist on the last lap of a race. His body shakes and throbs like a runaway steam engine, and the ear cannot follow the flying showers of notes—there is a pale blue mist where you look to see his bowing arm. With a most wonderful rush he comes to the end of the tune, and flings up his hands and staggers back exhausted; and with a final shout of delight the dancers fly apart, reeling here and there, bringing up against the walls of the room.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000071\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000071\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000072\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000072\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After this there is beer for every one, the musicians included, and the revelers take a long breath and prepare for the great event of the evening, which is the <i>acziavimas</i>.

There was a long rest for the orchestra, and plenty of refreshments, while Marija was making her peace with her victim, seating him upon the bar, and standing beside him and holding to his lips a foaming schooner of beer.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000083\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000083\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000084\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000084\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the meantime there was going on in another corner of the room an anxious conference between Teta Elzbieta and Dede Antanas, and a few of the more intimate friends of the family. A trouble was come upon them. The <i>veselija</i> is a compact, a compact not expressed, but therefore only the more binding upon all. Every one’s share was different—and yet every one knew perfectly well what his share was, and strove to give a little more. Now, however, since they had come to the new country, all this was changing; it seemed as if there must be some subtle poison in the air that one breathed here—it was affecting all the young men at once. They would come in crowds and fill themselves with a fine dinner, and then sneak off. One would throw another’s hat out of the window, and both would go out to get it, and neither could be seen again. Or now and then half a dozen of them would get together and march out openly, staring at you, and making fun of you to your face. Still others, worse yet, would crowd about the bar, and at the expense of the host drink themselves sodden, paying not the least attention to any one, and leaving it to be thought that either they had danced with the bride already, or meant to later on.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000085\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000085\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000086\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000086\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>All these things were going on now, and the family was helpless with dismay. So long they had toiled, and such an outlay they had made! Ona stood by, her eyes wide with terror. Those frightful bills—how they had haunted her, each item gnawing at her soul all day and spoiling her rest at night. How often she had named them over one by one and figured on them as she went to work—fifteen dollars for the hall, twenty-two dollars and a quarter for the ducks, twelve dollars for the musicians, five dollars at the church, and a blessing of the Virgin besides—and so on without an end! Worst of all was the frightful bill that was still to come from Graiczunas for the beer and liquor that might be consumed. One could never get in advance more than a guess as to this from a saloon-keeper—and then, when the time came he always came to you scratching his head and saying that he had guessed too low, but that he had done his best—your guests had gotten so very drunk. By him you were sure to be cheated unmercifully, and that even though you thought yourself the dearest of the hundreds of friends he had. He would begin to serve your guests out of a keg that was half full, and finish with one that was half empty, and then you would be charged for two kegs of beer. He would agree to serve a certain quality at a certain price, and when the time came you and your friends would be drinking some horrible poison that could not be described. You might complain, but you would get nothing for your pains but a ruined evening; while, as for going to law about it, you might as well go to heaven at once. The saloon-keeper stood in with all the big politics men in the district; and when you had once found out what it meant to get into trouble with such people, you would know enough to pay what you were told to pay and shut up.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000087\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000087\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000088\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000088\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>What made all this the more painful was that it was so hard on the few that had really done their best. There was poor old ponas Jokubas, for instance—he had already given five dollars, and did not every one know that Jokubas Szedvilas had just mortgaged his delicatessen store for two hundred dollars to meet several months’ overdue rent? And then there was withered old poni Aniele—who was a widow, and had three children, and the rheumatism besides, and did washing for the tradespeople on Halsted Street at prices it would break your heart to hear named. Aniele had given the entire profit of her chickens for several months. Eight of them she owned, and she kept them in a little place fenced around on her backstairs. All day long the children of Aniele were raking in the dump for food for these chickens; and sometimes, when the competition there was too fierce, you might see them on Halsted Street walking close to the gutters, and with their mother following to see that no one robbed them of their finds. Money could not tell the value of these chickens to old Mrs. Jukniene—she valued them differently, for she had a feeling that she was getting something for nothing by means of them—that with them she was getting the better of a world that was getting the better of her in so many other ways. So she watched them every hour of the day, and had learned to see like an owl at night to watch them then. One of them had been stolen long ago, and not a month passed that some one did not try to steal another. As the frustrating of this one attempt involved a score of false alarms, it will be understood what a tribute old Mrs. Jukniene brought, just because Teta Elzbieta had once loaned her some money for a few days and saved her from being turned out of her house.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000089\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000089\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000090\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000090\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>More and more friends gathered round while the lamentation about these things was going on. Some drew nearer, hoping to overhear the conversation, who were themselves among the guilty—and surely that was a thing to try the patience of a saint. Finally there came Jurgis, urged by some one, and the story was retold to him. Jurgis listened in silence, with his great black eyebrows knitted. Now and then there would come a gleam underneath them and he would glance about the room. Perhaps he would have liked to go at some of those fellows with his big clenched fists; but then, doubtless, he realized how little good it would do him. No bill would be any less for turning out any one at this time; and then there would be the scandal—and Jurgis wanted nothing except to get away with Ona and to let the world go its own way. So his hands relaxed and he merely said quietly: “It is done, and there is no use in weeping, Teta Elzbieta.” Then his look turned toward Ona, who stood close to his side, and he saw the wide look of terror in her eyes. “Little one,” he said, in a low voice, “do not worry—it will not matter to us. We will pay them all somehow. I will work harder.” That was always what Jurgis said. Ona had grown used to it as the solution of all difficulties—“I will work harder!” He had said that in Lithuania when one official had taken his passport from him, and another had arrested him for being without it, and the two had divided a third of his belongings. He had said it again in New York, when the smooth-spoken agent had taken them in hand and made them pay such high prices, and almost prevented their leaving his place, in spite of their paying. Now he said it a third time, and Ona drew a deep breath; it was so wonderful to have a husband, just like a grown woman—and a husband who could solve all problems, and who was so big and strong!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000091\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000091\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000092\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000092\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The last sob of little Sebastijonas has been stifled, and the orchestra has once more been reminded of its duty. The ceremony begins again—but there are few now left to dance with, and so very soon the collection is over and promiscuous dances once more begin. It is now after midnight, however, and things are not as they were before. The dancers are dull and heavy—most of them have been drinking hard, and have long ago passed the stage of exhilaration. They dance in monotonous measure, round after round, hour after hour, with eyes fixed upon vacancy, as if they were only half conscious, in a constantly growing stupor. The men grasp the women very tightly, but there will be half an hour together when neither will see the other’s face. Some couples do not care to dance, and have retired to the corners, where they sit with their arms enlaced. Others, who have been drinking still more, wander about the room, bumping into everything; some are in groups of two or three, singing, each group its own song. As time goes on there is a variety of drunkenness, among the younger men especially. Some stagger about in each other’s arms, whispering maudlin words—others start quarrels upon the slightest pretext, and come to blows and have to be pulled apart. Now the fat policeman wakens definitely, and feels of his club to see that it is ready for business. He has to be prompt—for these two-o’clock-in-the-morning fights, if they once get out of hand, are like a forest fire, and may mean the whole reserves at the station. The thing to do is to crack every fighting head that you see, before there are so many fighting heads that you cannot crack any of them. There is but scant account kept of cracked heads in back of the yards, for men who have to crack the heads of animals all day seem to get into the habit, and to practice on their friends, and even on their families, between times. This makes it a cause for congratulation that by modern methods a very few men can do the painfully necessary work of head-cracking for the whole of the cultured world.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000093\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000093\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000094\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000094\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>There is no fight that night—perhaps because Jurgis, too, is watchful—even more so than the policeman.

Only once there is a tight shave—and that is the fault of Marija Berczynskas. Marija has apparently concluded about two hours ago that if the altar in the corner, with the deity in soiled white, be not the true home of the muses, it is, at any rate, the nearest substitute on earth attainable. And Marija is just fighting drunk when there come to her ears the facts about the villains who have not paid that night. Marija goes on the warpath straight off, without even the preliminary of a good cursing, and when she is pulled off it is with the coat collars of two villains in her hands. Fortunately, the policeman is disposed to be reasonable, and so it is not Marija who is flung out of the place.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000095\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000095\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000096\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000096\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>All this interrupts the music for not more than a minute or two.

In the good old summertime—in the good old summertime!” There seems to be something hypnotic about this, with its endlessly recurring dominant. It has put a stupor upon every one who hears it, as well as upon the men who are playing it.

His father, and his father’s father before him, and as many ancestors back as legend could go, had lived in that part of Lithuania known as <i>Brelovicz</i>, the Imperial Forest. This is a great tract of a hundred thousand acres, which from time immemorial has been a hunting preserve of the nobility. There are a very few peasants settled in it, holding title from ancient times; and one of these was Antanas Rudkus, who had been reared himself, and had reared his children in turn, upon half a dozen acres of cleared land in the midst of a wilderness. There had been one son besides Jurgis, and one sister. The former had been drafted into the army; that had been over ten years ago, but since that day nothing had ever been heard of him. The sister was married, and her husband had bought the place when old Antanas had decided to go with his son.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000114\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000114\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000115\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000115\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was nearly a year and a half ago that Jurgis had met Ona, at a horse fair a hundred miles from home.

It grew darker all the time, and upon the earth the grass seemed to grow less green. Every minute, as the train sped on, the colors of things became dingier; the fields were grown parched and yellow, the landscape hideous and bare. And along with the thickening smoke they began to notice another circumstance, a strange, pungent odor. They were not sure that it was unpleasant, this odor; some might have called it sickening, but their taste in odors was not developed, and they were only sure that it was curious. Now, sitting in the trolley car, they realized that they were on their way to the home of it—that they had traveled all the way from Lithuania to it. It was now no longer something far off and faint, that you caught in whiffs; you could literally taste it, as well as smell it—you could take hold of it, almost, and examine it at your leisure. They were divided in their opinions about it. It was an elemental odor, raw and crude; it was rich, almost rancid, sensual, and strong. There were some who drank it in as if it were an intoxicant; there were others who put their handkerchiefs to their faces. The new emigrants were still tasting it, lost in wonder, when suddenly the car came to a halt, and the door was flung open, and a voice shouted—“Stockyards!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000132\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000132\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000133\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000133\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>They were left standing upon the corner, staring; down a side street there were two rows of brick houses, and between them a vista: half a dozen chimneys, tall as the tallest of buildings, touching the very sky—and leaping from them half a dozen columns of smoke, thick, oily, and black as night.

Jokubas understood all the pitfalls of this new world, and could explain all of its mysteries; he could tell them the things they ought to have done in the different emergencies—and what was still more to the point, he could tell them what to do now. He would take them to poni Aniele, who kept a boardinghouse the other side of the yards; old Mrs. Jukniene, he explained, had not what one would call choice accommodations, but they might do for the moment. To this Teta Elzbieta hastened to respond that nothing could be too cheap to suit them just then; for they were quite terrified over the sums they had had to expend. A very few days of practical experience in this land of high wages had been sufficient to make clear to them the cruel fact that it was also a land of high prices, and that in it the poor man was almost as poor as in any other corner of the earth; and so there vanished in a night all the wonderful dreams of wealth that had been haunting Jurgis. What had made the discovery all the more painful was that they were spending, at American prices, money which they had earned at home rates of wages—and so were really being cheated by the world!

Some of these places were kept by private persons, some were cooperative. There would be an average of half a dozen boarders to each room—sometimes there were thirteen or fourteen to one room, fifty or sixty to a flat. Each one of the occupants furnished his own accommodations—that is, a mattress and some bedding. The mattresses would be spread upon the floor in rows—and there would be nothing else in the place except a stove. It was by no means unusual for two men to own the same mattress in common, one working by day and using it by night, and the other working at night and using it in the daytime.

Undoubtedly this did keep down the vermin, but it seemed probable, in view of all the circumstances, that the old lady regarded it rather as feeding the chickens than as cleaning the rooms.

In back of the yards the dreary two-story frame houses were scattered farther apart, and there were great spaces bare—that seemingly had been overlooked by the great sore of a city as it spread itself over the surface of the prairie. These bare places were grown up with dingy, yellow weeds, hiding innumerable tomato cans; innumerable children played upon them, chasing one another here and there, screaming and fighting. The most uncanny thing about this neighborhood was the number of the children; you thought there must be a school just out, and it was only after long acquaintance that you were able to realize that there was no school, but that these were the children of the neighborhood—that there were so many children to the block in Packingtown that nowhere on its streets could a horse and buggy move faster than a walk!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000148\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000148\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000149\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000149\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It could not move faster anyhow, on account of the state of the streets. Those through which Jurgis and Ona were walking resembled streets less than they did a miniature topographical map. The roadway was commonly several feet lower than the level of the houses, which were sometimes joined by high board walks; there were no pavements—there were mountains and valleys and rivers, gullies and ditches, and great hollows full of stinking green water. In these pools the children played, and rolled about in the mud of the streets; here and there one noticed them digging in it, after trophies which they had stumbled on. One wondered about this, as also about the swarms of flies which hung about the scene, literally blackening the air, and the strange, fetid odor which assailed one’s nostrils, a ghastly odor, of all the dead things of the universe. It impelled the visitor to questions and then the residents would explain, quietly, that all this was “made” land, and that it had been “made” by using it as a dumping ground for the city garbage. After a few years the unpleasant effect of this would pass away, it was said; but meantime, in hot weather—and especially when it rained—the flies were apt to be annoying.

Was it permitted to believe that there was nowhere upon the earth, or above the earth, a heaven for hogs, where they were requited for all this suffering? Each one of these hogs was a separate creature. Some were white hogs, some were black; some were brown, some were spotted; some were old, some young; some were long and lean, some were monstrous. And each of them had an individuality of his own, a will of his own, a hope and a heart’s desire; each was full of self-confidence, of self-importance, and a sense of dignity. And trusting and strong in faith he had gone about his business, the while a black shadow hung over him and a horrid Fate waited in his pathway. Now suddenly it had swooped upon him, and had seized him by the leg. Relentless, remorseless, it was; all his protests, his screams, were nothing to it—it did its cruel will with him, as if his wishes, his feelings, had simply no existence at all; it cut his throat and watched him gasp out his life. And now was one to believe that there was nowhere a god of hogs, to whom this hog personality was precious, to whom these hog squeals and agonies had a meaning? Who would take this hog into his arms and comfort him, reward him for his work well done, and show him the meaning of his sacrifice? Perhaps some glimpse of all this was in the thoughts of our humble-minded Jurgis, as he turned to go on with the rest of the party, and muttered: “Dieve—but I’m glad I’m not a hog!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000221\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000221\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000222\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000222\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The carcass hog was scooped out of the vat by machinery, and then it fell to the second floor, passing on the way through a wonderful machine with numerous scrapers, which adjusted themselves to the size and shape of the animal, and sent it out at the other end with nearly all of its bristles removed.

Here came the entrails, to be scraped and washed clean for sausage casings; men and women worked here in the midst of a sickening stench, which caused the visitors to hasten by, gasping. To another room came all the scraps to be “tanked,” which meant boiling and pumping off the grease to make soap and lard; below they took out the refuse, and this, too, was a region in which the visitors did not linger. In still other places men were engaged in cutting up the carcasses that had been through the chilling rooms. First there were the “splitters,” the most expert workmen in the plant, who earned as high as fifty cents an hour, and did not a thing all day except chop hogs down the middle. Then there were “cleaver men,” great giants with muscles of iron; each had two men to attend him—to slide the half carcass in front of him on the table, and hold it while he chopped it, and then turn each piece so that he might chop it once more. His cleaver had a blade about two feet long, and he never made but one cut; he made it so neatly, too, that his implement did not smite through and dull itself—there was just enough force for a perfect cut, and no more. So through various yawning holes there slipped to the floor below—to one room hams, to another forequarters, to another sides of pork. One might go down to this floor and see the pickling rooms, where the hams were put into vats, and the great smoke rooms, with their airtight iron doors. In other rooms they prepared salt pork—there were whole cellars full of it, built up in great towers to the ceiling. In yet other rooms they were putting up meats in boxes and barrels, and wrapping hams and bacon in oiled paper, sealing and labeling and sewing them. From the doors of these rooms went men with loaded trucks, to the platform where freight cars were waiting to be filled; and one went out there and realized with a start that he had come at last to the ground floor of this enormous building.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000229\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000229\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000230\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000230\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then the party went across the street to where they did the killing of beef—where every hour they turned four or five hundred cattle into meat.

First there came the “butcher,” to bleed them; this meant one swift stroke, so swift that you could not see it—only the flash of the knife; and before you could realize it, the man had darted on to the next line, and a stream of bright red was pouring out upon the floor. This floor was half an inch deep with blood, in spite of the best efforts of men who kept shoveling it through holes; it must have made the floor slippery, but no one could have guessed this by watching the men at work.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000235\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000235\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000236\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000236\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The carcass hung for a few minutes to bleed; there was no time lost, however, for there were several hanging in each line, and one was always ready.

Then came the “floorsman,” to make the first cut in the skin; and then another to finish ripping the skin down the center; and then half a dozen more in swift succession, to finish the skinning. After they were through, the carcass was again swung up; and while a man with a stick examined the skin, to make sure that it had not been cut, and another rolled it up and tumbled it through one of the inevitable holes in the floor, the beef proceeded on its journey. There were men to cut it, and men to split it, and men to gut it and scrape it clean inside. There were some with hose which threw jets of boiling water upon it, and others who removed the feet and added the final touches.

And then the visitors were taken to the other parts of the building, to see what became of each particle of the waste material that had vanished through the floor; and to the pickling rooms, and the salting rooms, the canning rooms, and the packing rooms, where choice meat was prepared for shipping in refrigerator cars, destined to be eaten in all the four corners of civilization. Afterward they went outside, wandering about among the mazes of buildings in which was done the work auxiliary to this great industry. There was scarcely a thing needed in the business that Durham and Company did not make for themselves. There was a great steam power plant and an electricity plant. There was a barrel factory, and a boiler-repair shop. There was a building to which the grease was piped, and made into soap and lard; and then there was a factory for making lard cans, and another for making soap boxes. There was a building in which the bristles were cleaned and dried, for the making of hair cushions and such things; there was a building where the skins were dried and tanned, there was another where heads and feet were made into glue, and another where bones were made into fertilizer. No tiniest particle of organic matter was wasted in Durham’s. Out of the horns of the cattle they made combs, buttons, hairpins, and imitation ivory; out of the shinbones and other big bones they cut knife and toothbrush handles, and mouthpieces for pipes; out of the hoofs they cut hairpins and buttons, before they made the rest into glue. From such things as feet, knuckles, hide clippings, and sinews came such strange and unlikely products as gelatin, isinglass, and phosphorus, bone black, shoe blacking, and bone oil. They had curled-hair works for the cattle tails, and a “wool pullery” for the sheepskins; they made pepsin from the stomachs of the pigs, and albumen from the blood, and violin strings from the ill-smelling entrails. When there was nothing else to be done with a thing, they first put it into a tank and got out of it all the tallow and grease, and then they made it into fertilizer. All these industries were gathered into buildings near by, connected by galleries and railroads with the main establishment; and it was estimated that they had handled nearly a quarter of a billion of animals since the founding of the plant by the elder Durham a generation and more ago. If you counted with it the other big plants—and they were now really all one—it was, so Jokubas informed them, the greatest aggregation of labor and capital ever gathered in one place. It employed thirty thousand men; it supported directly two hundred and fifty thousand people in its neighborhood, and indirectly it supported half a million. It sent its products to every country in the civilized world, and it furnished the food for no less than thirty million people!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000239\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000239\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000240\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000240\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>To all of these things our friends would listen open-mouthed—it seemed to them impossible of belief that anything so stupendous could have been devised by mortal man.

Jurgis was even glad that he had not seen the place before meeting with his triumph, for he felt that the size of it would have overwhelmed him. But now he had been admitted—he was a part of it all! He had the feeling that this whole huge establishment had taken him under its protection, and had become responsible for his welfare. So guileless was he, and ignorant of the nature of business, that he did not even realize that he had become an employee of Brown’s, and that Brown and Durham were supposed by all the world to be deadly rivals—were even required to be deadly rivals by the law of the land, and ordered to try to ruin each other under penalty of fine and imprisonment!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000241\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000241\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000242\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000242\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000243\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000243\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER IV</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000244\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000244\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000245\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000245\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Promptly at seven the next morning Jurgis reported for work. He came to the door that had been pointed out to him, and there he waited for nearly two hours. The boss had meant for him to enter, but had not said this, and so it was only when on his way out to hire another man that he came upon Jurgis. He gave him a good cursing, but as Jurgis did not understand a word of it he did not object. He followed the boss, who showed him where to put his street clothes, and waited while he donned the working clothes he had bought in a secondhand shop and brought with him in a bundle; then he led him to the “killing beds.” The work which Jurgis was to do here was very simple, and it took him but a few minutes to learn it. He was provided with a stiff besom, such as is used by street sweepers, and it was his place to follow down the line the man who drew out the smoking entrails from the carcass of the steer; this mass was to be swept into a trap, which was then closed, so that no one might slip into it. As Jurgis came in, the first cattle of the morning were just making their appearance; and so, with scarcely time to look about him, and none to speak to any one, he fell to work. It was a sweltering day in July, and the place ran with steaming hot blood—one waded in it on the floor. The stench was almost overpowering, but to Jurgis it was nothing. His whole soul was dancing with joy—he was at work at last! He was at work and earning money! All day long he was figuring to himself. He was paid the fabulous sum of seventeen and a half cents an hour; and as it proved a rush day and he worked until nearly seven o’clock in the evening, he went home to the family with the tidings that he had earned more than a dollar and a half in a single day!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000246\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000246\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000247\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000247\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>At home, also, there was more good news; so much of it at once that there was quite a celebration in Aniele’s hall bedroom. Jonas had been to have an interview with the special policeman to whom Szedvilas had introduced him, and had been taken to see several of the bosses, with the result that one had promised him a job the beginning of the next week. And then there was Marija Berczynskas, who, fired with jealousy by the success of Jurgis, had set out upon her own responsibility to get a place. Marija had nothing to take with her save her two brawny arms and the word “job,” laboriously learned; but with these she had marched about Packingtown all day, entering every door where there were signs of activity. Out of some she had been ordered with curses; but Marija was not afraid of man or devil, and asked every one she saw—visitors and strangers, or work-people like herself, and once or twice even high and lofty office personages, who stared at her as if they thought she was crazy. In the end, however, she had reaped her reward. In one of the smaller plants she had stumbled upon a room where scores of women and girls were sitting at long tables preparing smoked beef in cans; and wandering through room after room, Marija came at last to the place where the sealed cans were being painted and labeled, and here she had the good fortune to encounter the “forelady.” Marija did not understand then, as she was destined to understand later, what there was attractive to a “forelady” about the combination of a face full of boundless good nature and the muscles of a dray horse; but the woman had told her to come the next day and she would perhaps give her a chance to learn the trade of painting cans. The painting of cans being skilled piecework, and paying as much as two dollars a day, Marija burst in upon the family with the yell of a Comanche Indian, and fell to capering about the room so as to frighten the baby almost into convulsions.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000248\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000248\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000249\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000249\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Better luck than all this could hardly have been hoped for; there was only one of them left to seek a place.

It was nearly two feet long, printed on calendered paper, with a selection of colors so bright that they shone even in the moonlight. The center of the placard was occupied by a house, brilliantly painted, new, and dazzling. The roof of it was of a purple hue, and trimmed with gold; the house itself was silvery, and the doors and windows red. It was a two-story building, with a porch in front, and a very fancy scrollwork around the edges; it was complete in every tiniest detail, even the doorknob, and there was a hammock on the porch and white lace curtains in the windows. Underneath this, in one corner, was a picture of a husband and wife in loving embrace; in the opposite corner was a cradle, with fluffy curtains drawn over it, and a smiling cherub hovering upon silver-colored wings. For fear that the significance of all this should be lost, there was a label, in Polish, Lithuanian, and German—“<i>Dom. Namai. Heim.</i>” “Why pay rent?” the linguistic circular went on to demand. “Why not own your own home? Do you know that you can buy one for less than your rent? We have built thousands of homes which are now occupied by happy families.”—So it became eloquent, picturing the blissfulness of married life in a house with nothing to pay. It even quoted “Home, Sweet Home,” and made bold to translate it into Polish—though for some reason it omitted the Lithuanian of this. Perhaps the translator found it a difficult matter to be sentimental in a language in which a sob is known as a gukcziojimas and a smile as a nusiszypsojimas.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000256\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000256\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000257\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000257\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Over this document the family pored long, while Ona spelled out its contents.

If they all combined, they would have enough to make the first payment; and if they had employment, so that they could be sure of the future, it might really prove the best plan. It was, of course, not a thing even to be talked of lightly; it was a thing they would have to sift to the bottom.

That evening the three made their report to the men—the thing was altogether as represented in the circular, or at any rate so the agent had said. The houses lay to the south, about a mile and a half from the yards; they were wonderful bargains, the gentleman had assured them—personally, and for their own good. He could do this, so he explained to them, for the reason that he had himself no interest in their sale—he was merely the agent for a company that had built them. These were the last, and the company was going out of business, so if any one wished to take advantage of this wonderful no-rent plan, he would have to be very quick. As a matter of fact there was just a little uncertainty as to whether there was a single house left; for the agent had taken so many people to see them, and for all he knew the company might have parted with the last. Seeing Teta Elzbieta’s evident grief at this news, he added, after some hesitation, that if they really intended to make a purchase, he would send a telephone message at his own expense, and have one of the houses kept.

He was a smooth and florid personage, elegantly dressed, and he spoke their language freely, which gave him a great advantage in dealing with them.

Ona’s heart sank, for the house was not as it was shown in the picture; the color scheme was different, for one thing, and then it did not seem quite so big. Still, it was freshly painted, and made a considerable show. It was all brand-new, so the agent told them, but he talked so incessantly that they were quite confused, and did not have time to ask many questions. There were all sorts of things they had made up their minds to inquire about, but when the time came, they either forgot them or lacked the courage. The other houses in the row did not seem to be new, and few of them seemed to be occupied. When they ventured to hint at this, the agent’s reply was that the purchasers would be moving in shortly.

The house inside contained four rooms, plastered white; the basement was but a frame, the walls being unplastered and the floor not laid. The agent explained that the houses were built that way, as the purchasers generally preferred to finish the basements to suit their own taste. The attic was also unfinished—the family had been figuring that in case of an emergency they could rent this attic, but they found that there was not even a floor, nothing but joists, and beneath them the lath and plaster of the ceiling below.

After half an hour of such depressing conversation, they had their minds quite made up that they had been saved at the brink of a precipice; but then Szedvilas went away, and Jonas, who was a sharp little man, reminded them that the delicatessen business was a failure, according to its proprietor, and that this might account for his pessimistic views.

Jurgis had given them so many instructions and warned them against so many perils, that the women were quite pale with fright, and even the imperturbable delicatessen vender, who prided himself upon being a businessman, was ill at ease. The agent had the deed all ready, and invited them to sit down and read it; this Szedvilas proceeded to do—a painful and laborious process, during which the agent drummed upon the desk. Teta Elzbieta was so embarrassed that the perspiration came out upon her forehead in beads; for was not this reading as much as to say plainly to the gentleman’s face that they doubted his honesty? Yet Jokubas Szedvilas read on and on; and presently there developed that he had good reason for doing so. For a horrible suspicion had begun dawning in his mind; he knitted his brows more and more as he read. This was not a deed of sale at all, so far as he could see—it provided only for the renting of the property! It was hard to tell, with all this strange legal jargon, words he had never heard before; but was not this plain—“the party of the first part hereby covenants and agrees to rent to the said party of the second part!” And then again—“a monthly <i>rental</i> of twelve dollars, for a period of eight years and four months!” Then Szedvilas took off his spectacles, and looked at the agent, and stammered a question.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000278\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000278\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000279\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000279\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The agent was most polite, and explained that that was the usual formula; that it was always arranged that the property should be merely rented. He kept trying to show them something in the next paragraph; but Szedvilas could not get by the word “rental”—and when he translated it to Teta Elzbieta, she too was thrown into a fright. They would not own the home at all, then, for nearly nine years! The agent, with infinite patience, began to explain again; but no explanation would do now. Elzbieta had firmly fixed in her mind the last solemn warning of Jurgis: “If there is anything wrong, do not give him the money, but go out and get a lawyer.” It was an agonizing moment, but she sat in the chair, her hands clenched like death, and made a fearful effort, summoning all her powers, and gasped out her purpose.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000280\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000280\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000281\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000281\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Jokubas translated her words. She expected the agent to fly into a passion, but he was, to her bewilderment, as ever imperturbable; he even offered to go and get a lawyer for her, but she declined this. They went a long way, on purpose to find a man who would not be a confederate. Then let any one imagine their dismay, when, after half an hour, they came in with a lawyer, and heard him greet the agent by his first name! They felt that all was lost; they sat like prisoners summoned to hear the reading of their death warrant. There was nothing more that they could do—they were trapped! The lawyer read over the deed, and when he had read it he informed Szedvilas that it was all perfectly regular, that the deed was a blank deed such as was often used in these sales. And was the price as agreed? the old man asked—three hundred dollars down, and the balance at twelve dollars a month, till the total of fifteen hundred dollars had been paid? Yes, that was correct. And it was for the sale of such and such a house—the house and lot and everything? Yes,—and the lawyer showed him where that was all written. And it was all perfectly regular—there were no tricks about it of any sort? They were poor people, and this was all they had in the world, and if there was anything wrong they would be ruined. And so Szedvilas went on, asking one trembling question after another, while the eyes of the women folks were fixed upon him in mute agony. They could not understand what he was saying, but they knew that upon it their fate depended. And when at last he had questioned until there was no more questioning to be done, and the time came for them to make up their minds, and either close the bargain or reject it, it was all that poor Teta Elzbieta could do to keep from bursting into tears. Jokubas had asked her if she wished to sign; he had asked her twice—and what could she say? How did she know if this lawyer were telling the truth—that he was not in the conspiracy? And yet, how could she say so—what excuse could she give? The eyes of every one in the room were upon her, awaiting her decision; and at last, half blind with her tears, she began fumbling in her jacket, where she had pinned the precious money. And she brought it out and unwrapped it before the men. All of this Ona sat watching, from a corner of the room, twisting her hands together, meantime, in a fever of fright. Ona longed to cry out and tell her stepmother to stop, that it was all a trap; but there seemed to be something clutching her by the throat, and she could not make a sound. And so Teta Elzbieta laid the money on the table, and the agent picked it up and counted it, and then wrote them a receipt for it and passed them the deed. Then he gave a sigh of satisfaction, and rose and shook hands with them all, still as smooth and polite as at the beginning. Ona had a dim recollection of the lawyer telling Szedvilas that his charge was a dollar, which occasioned some debate, and more agony; and then, after they had paid that, too, they went out into the street, her stepmother clutching the deed in her hand. They were so weak from fright that they could not walk, but had to sit down on the way.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000282\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000282\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000283\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000283\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So they went home, with a deadly terror gnawing at their souls; and that evening Jurgis came home and heard their story, and that was the end.

It was quite touching, the zeal of people to see that his health and happiness were provided for. Did the person wish to smoke? There was a little discourse about cigars, showing him exactly why the Thomas Jefferson Five-cent Perfecto was the only cigar worthy of the name. Had he, on the other hand, smoked too much? Here was a remedy for the smoking habit, twenty-five doses for a quarter, and a cure absolutely guaranteed in ten doses. In innumerable ways such as this, the traveler found that somebody had been busied to make smooth his paths through the world, and to let him know what had been done for him. In Packingtown the advertisements had a style all of their own, adapted to the peculiar population. One would be tenderly solicitous. “Is your wife pale?” it would inquire. “Is she discouraged, does she drag herself about the house and find fault with everything? Why do you not tell her to try Dr. Lanahan’s Life Preservers?” Another would be jocular in tone, slapping you on the back, so to speak. “Don’t be a chump!” it would exclaim. “Go and get the Goliath Bunion Cure.” “Get a move on you!” would chime in another. “It’s easy, if you wear the Eureka Two-fifty Shoe.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000307\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000307\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000308\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000308\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Among these importunate signs was one that had caught the attention of the family by its pictures. It showed two very pretty little birds building themselves a home; and Marija had asked an acquaintance to read it to her, and told them that it related to the furnishing of a house. “Feather your nest,” it ran—and went on to say that it could furnish all the necessary feathers for a four-room nest for the ludicrously small sum of seventy-five dollars. The particularly important thing about this offer was that only a small part of the money need be had at once—the rest one might pay a few dollars every month. Our friends had to have some furniture, there was no getting away from that; but their little fund of money had sunk so low that they could hardly get to sleep at night, and so they fled to this as their deliverance. There was more agony and another paper for Elzbieta to sign, and then one night when Jurgis came home, he was told the breathless tidings that the furniture had arrived and was safely stowed in the house: a parlor set of four pieces, a bedroom set of three pieces, a dining room table and four chairs, a toilet set with beautiful pink roses painted all over it, an assortment of crockery, also with pink roses—and so on. One of the plates in the set had been found broken when they unpacked it, and Ona was going to the store the first thing in the morning to make them change it; also they had promised three saucepans, and there had only two come, and did Jurgis think that they were trying to cheat them?</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000309\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000309\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000310\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000310\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The next day they went to the house; and when the men came from work they ate a few hurried mouthfuls at Aniele’s, and then set to work at the task of carrying their belongings to their new home. The distance was in reality over two miles, but Jurgis made two trips that night, each time with a huge pile of mattresses and bedding on his head, with bundles of clothing and bags and things tied up inside. Anywhere else in Chicago he would have stood a good chance of being arrested; but the policemen in Packingtown were apparently used to these informal movings, and contented themselves with a cursory examination now and then. It was quite wonderful to see how fine the house looked, with all the things in it, even by the dim light of a lamp: it was really home, and almost as exciting as the placard had described it. Ona was fairly dancing, and she and Cousin Marija took Jurgis by the arm and escorted him from room to room, sitting in each chair by turns, and then insisting that he should do the same. One chair squeaked with his great weight, and they screamed with fright, and woke the baby and brought everybody running. Altogether it was a great day; and tired as they were, Jurgis and Ona sat up late, contented simply to hold each other and gaze in rapture about the room. They were going to be married as soon as they could get everything settled, and a little spare money put by; and this was to be their home—that little room yonder would be theirs!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000311\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000311\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000312\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000312\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was in truth a never-ending delight, the fixing up of this house. They had no money to spend for the pleasure of spending, but there were a few absolutely necessary things, and the buying of these was a perpetual adventure for Ona. It must always be done at night, so that Jurgis could go along; and even if it were only a pepper cruet, or half a dozen glasses for ten cents, that was enough for an expedition. On Saturday night they came home with a great basketful of things, and spread them out on the table, while every one stood round, and the children climbed up on the chairs, or howled to be lifted up to see. There were sugar and salt and tea and crackers, and a can of lard and a milk pail, and a scrubbing brush, and a pair of shoes for the second oldest boy, and a can of oil, and a tack hammer, and a pound of nails. These last were to be driven into the walls of the kitchen and the bedrooms, to hang things on; and there was a family discussion as to the place where each one was to be driven. Then Jurgis would try to hammer, and hit his fingers because the hammer was too small, and get mad because Ona had refused to let him pay fifteen cents more and get a bigger hammer; and Ona would be invited to try it herself, and hurt her thumb, and cry out, which necessitated the thumb’s being kissed by Jurgis. Finally, after every one had had a try, the nails would be driven, and something hung up. Jurgis had come home with a big packing box on his head, and he sent Jonas to get another that he had bought. He meant to take one side out of these tomorrow, and put shelves in them, and make them into bureaus and places to keep things for the bedrooms.

Then he saw things in a different light, he got at the inside of them. The pace they set here, it was one that called for every faculty of a man—from the instant the first steer fell till the sounding of the noon whistle, and again from half-past twelve till heaven only knew what hour in the late afternoon or evening, there was never one instant’s rest for a man, for his hand or his eye or his brain. Jurgis saw how they managed it; there were portions of the work which determined the pace of the rest, and for these they had picked men whom they paid high wages, and whom they changed frequently. You might easily pick out these pacemakers, for they worked under the eye of the bosses, and they worked like men possessed. This was called “speeding up the gang,” and if any man could not keep up with the pace, there were hundreds outside begging to try.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000317\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000317\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000318\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000318\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Yet Jurgis did not mind it; he rather enjoyed it.

He had had no experience with unions, and he had to have it explained to him that the men were banded together for the purpose of fighting for their rights. Jurgis asked them what they meant by their rights, a question in which he was quite sincere, for he had not any idea of any rights that he had, except the right to hunt for a job, and do as he was told when he got it. Generally, however, this harmless question would only make his fellow workingmen lose their tempers and call him a fool. There was a delegate of the butcher-helpers’ union who came to see Jurgis to enroll him; and when Jurgis found that this meant that he would have to part with some of his money, he froze up directly, and the delegate, who was an Irishman and only knew a few words of Lithuanian, lost his temper and began to threaten him. In the end Jurgis got into a fine rage, and made it sufficiently plain that it would take more than one Irishman to scare him into a union. Little by little he gathered that the main thing the men wanted was to put a stop to the habit of “speeding-up”; they were trying their best to force a lessening of the pace, for there were some, they said, who could not keep up with it, whom it was killing. But Jurgis had no sympathy with such ideas as this—he could do the work himself, and so could the rest of them, he declared, if they were good for anything. If they couldn’t do it, let them go somewhere else. Jurgis had not studied the books, and he would not have known how to pronounce “laissez faire”; but he had been round the world enough to know that a man has to shift for himself in it, and that if he gets the worst of it, there is nobody to listen to him holler.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000323\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000323\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000324\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000324\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Yet there have been known to be philosophers and plain men who swore by Malthus in the books, and would, nevertheless, subscribe to a relief fund in time of a famine.

The friend, who was named Tamoszius Kuszleika, was a sharp little man who folded hides on the killing beds, and he listened to what Jurgis had to say without seeming at all surprised. They were common enough, he said, such cases of petty graft. It was simply some boss who proposed to add a little to his income. After Jurgis had been there awhile he would know that the plants were simply honeycombed with rottenness of that sort—the bosses grafted off the men, and they grafted off each other; and some day the superintendent would find out about the boss, and then he would graft off the boss. Warming to the subject, Tamoszius went on to explain the situation. Here was Durham’s, for instance, owned by a man who was trying to make as much money out of it as he could, and did not care in the least how he did it; and underneath him, ranged in ranks and grades like an army, were managers and superintendents and foremen, each one driving the man next below him and trying to squeeze out of him as much work as possible. And all the men of the same rank were pitted against each other; the accounts of each were kept separately, and every man lived in terror of losing his job, if another made a better record than he. So from top to bottom the place was simply a seething caldron of jealousies and hatreds; there was no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there was no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar. And worse than there being no decency, there was not even any honesty. The reason for that? Who could say? It must have been old Durham in the beginning; it was a heritage which the self-made merchant had left to his son, along with his millions.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000329\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000329\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000330\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000330\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Jurgis would find out these things for himself, if he stayed there long enough; it was the men who had to do all the dirty jobs, and so there was no deceiving them; and they caught the spirit of the place, and did like all the rest.

She had taken the place of an Irishwoman who had been working in that factory ever since any one could remember. For over fifteen years, so she declared. Mary Dennis was her name, and a long time ago she had been seduced, and had a little boy; he was a cripple, and an epileptic, but still he was all that she had in the world to love, and they had lived in a little room alone somewhere back of Halsted Street, where the Irish were. Mary had had consumption, and all day long you might hear her coughing as she worked; of late she had been going all to pieces, and when Marija came, the “forelady” had suddenly decided to turn her off. The forelady had to come up to a certain standard herself, and could not stop for sick people, Jadvyga explained. The fact that Mary had been there so long had not made any difference to her—it was doubtful if she even knew that, for both the forelady and the superintendent were new people, having only been there two or three years themselves. Jadvyga did not know what had become of the poor creature; she would have gone to see her, but had been sick herself. She had pains in her back all the time, Jadvyga explained, and feared that she had womb trouble.

To Teta Elzbieta especially the very suggestion was an affliction. What! she would cry. To be married on the roadside like a parcel of beggars! No! No!—Elzbieta had some traditions behind her; she had been a person of importance in her girlhood—had lived on a big estate and had servants, and might have married well and been a lady, but for the fact that there had been nine daughters and no sons in the family. Even so, however, she knew what was decent, and clung to her traditions with desperation. They were not going to lose all caste, even if they had come to be unskilled laborers in Packingtown; and that Ona had even talked of omitting a <i>veselija</i> was enough to keep her stepmother lying awake all night. It was in vain for them to say that they had so few friends; they were bound to have friends in time, and then the friends would talk about it. They must not give up what was right for a little money—if they did, the money would never do them any good, they could depend upon that. And Elzbieta would call upon Dede Antanas to support her; there was a fear in the souls of these two, lest this journey to a new country might somehow undermine the old home virtues of their children. The very first Sunday they had all been taken to mass; and poor as they were, Elzbieta had felt it advisable to invest a little of her resources in a representation of the babe of Bethlehem, made in plaster, and painted in brilliant colors. Though it was only a foot high, there was a shrine with four snow-white steeples, and the Virgin standing with her child in her arms, and the kings and shepherds and wise men bowing down before him. It had cost fifty cents; but Elzbieta had a feeling that money spent for such things was not to be counted too closely, it would come back in hidden ways. The piece was beautiful on the parlor mantel, and one could not have a home without some sort of ornament.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000352\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000352\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000353\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000353\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The cost of the wedding feast would, of course, be returned to them; but the problem was to raise it even temporarily.

The house was one of a whole row that was built by a company which existed to make money by swindling poor people. The family had paid fifteen hundred dollars for it, and it had not cost the builders five hundred, when it was new.

When they failed—if it were only by a single month—they would lose the house and all that they had paid on it, and then the company would sell it over again.

The families had all been of different nationalities—there had been a representative of several races that had displaced each other in the stockyards. Grandmother Majauszkiene had come to America with her son at a time when so far as she knew there was only one other Lithuanian family in the district; the workers had all been Germans then—skilled cattle butchers that the packers had brought from abroad to start the business. Afterward, as cheaper labor had come, these Germans had moved away. The next were the Irish—there had been six or eight years when Packingtown had been a regular Irish city. There were a few colonies of them still here, enough to run all the unions and the police force and get all the graft; but most of those who were working in the packing houses had gone away at the next drop in wages—after the big strike. The Bohemians had come then, and after them the Poles. People said that old man Durham himself was responsible for these immigrations; he had sworn that he would fix the people of Packingtown so that they would never again call a strike on him, and so he had sent his agents into every city and village in Europe to spread the tale of the chances of work and high wages at the stockyards. The people had come in hordes; and old Durham had squeezed them tighter and tighter, speeding them up and grinding them to pieces and sending for new ones. The Poles, who had come by tens of thousands, had been driven to the wall by the Lithuanians, and now the Lithuanians were giving way to the Slovaks. Who there was poorer and more miserable than the Slovaks, Grandmother Majauszkiene had no idea, but the packers would find them, never fear. It was easy to bring them, for wages were really much higher, and it was only when it was too late that the poor people found out that everything else was higher too. They were like rats in a trap, that was the truth; and more of them were piling in every day. By and by they would have their revenge, though, for the thing was getting beyond human endurance, and the people would rise and murder the packers. Grandmother Majauszkiene was a socialist, or some such strange thing; another son of hers was working in the mines of Siberia, and the old lady herself had made speeches in her time—which made her seem all the more terrible to her present auditors.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000362\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000362\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000363\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000363\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>They called her back to the story of the house.

He had gone all to ruin with the drink, however, and lost his power; one of his sons, who was a good man, had kept him and the family up for a year or two, but then he had got sick with consumption.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000366\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000366\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000367\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000367\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>That was another thing, Grandmother Majauszkiene interrupted herself—this house was unlucky. Every family that lived in it, some one was sure to get consumption. Nobody could tell why that was; there must be something about the house, or the way it was built—some folks said it was because the building had been begun in the dark of the moon. There were dozens of houses that way in Packingtown. Sometimes there would be a particular room that you could point out—if anybody slept in that room he was just as good as dead. With this house it had been the Irish first; and then a Bohemian family had lost a child of it—though, to be sure, that was uncertain, since it was hard to tell what was the matter with children who worked in the yards. In those days there had been no law about the age of children—the packers had worked all but the babies. At this remark the family looked puzzled, and Grandmother Majauszkiene again had to make an explanation—that it was against the law for children to work before they were sixteen. What was the sense of that? they asked. They had been thinking of letting little Stanislovas go to work. Well, there was no need to worry, Grandmother Majauszkiene said—the law made no difference except that it forced people to lie about the ages of their children. One would like to know what the lawmakers expected them to do; there were families that had no possible means of support except the children, and the law provided them no other way of getting a living. Very often a man could get no work in Packingtown for months, while a child could go and get a place easily; there was always some new machine, by which the packers could get as much work out of a child as they had been able to get out of a man, and for a third of the pay.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000368\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000368\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000369\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000369\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>To come back to the house again, it was the woman of the next family that had died.

That was a bid, so Marija reported, after consulting her friend; and then there was an anxious conference at home.

The lard was finished on the floor above, and it came in little jets, like beautiful, wriggling, snow-white snakes of unpleasant odor. There were several kinds and sizes of jets, and after a certain precise quantity had come out, each stopped automatically, and the wonderful machine made a turn, and took the can under another jet, and so on, until it was filled neatly to the brim, and pressed tightly, and smoothed off. To attend to all this and fill several hundred cans of lard per hour, there were necessary two human creatures, one of whom knew how to place an empty lard can on a certain spot every few seconds, and the other of whom knew how to take a full lard can off a certain spot every few seconds and set it upon a tray.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000400\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000400\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000401\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000401\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And so, after little Stanislovas had stood gazing timidly about him for a few minutes, a man approached him, and asked what he wanted, to which Stanislovas said, “Job.” Then the man said “How old?” and Stanislovas answered, “Sixtin.” Once or twice every year a state inspector would come wandering through the packing plants, asking a child here and there how old he was; and so the packers were very careful to comply with the law, which cost them as much trouble as was now involved in the boss’s taking the document from the little boy, and glancing at it, and then sending it to the office to be filed away.

In summer the stench of the warm lard would be nauseating, and in winter the cans would all but freeze to his naked little fingers in the unheated cellar. Half the year it would be dark as night when he went in to work, and dark as night again when he came out, and so he would never know what the sun looked like on weekdays. And for this, at the end of the week, he would carry home three dollars to his family, being his pay at the rate of five cents per hour—just about his proper share of the total earnings of the million and three-quarters of children who are now engaged in earning their livings in the United States.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000402\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000402\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000403\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000403\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And meantime, because they were young, and hope is not to be stifled before its time, Jurgis and Ona were again calculating; for they had discovered that the wages of Stanislovas would a little more than pay the interest, which left them just about as they had been before!

Here he was, for instance, vowing upon his knees that he would save Ona from harm, and only a week later she was suffering atrociously, and from the blow of an enemy that he could not possibly have thwarted. There came a day when the rain fell in torrents; and it being December, to be wet with it and have to sit all day long in one of the cold cellars of Brown’s was no laughing matter. Ona was a working girl, and did not own waterproofs and such things, and so Jurgis took her and put her on the streetcar. Now it chanced that this car line was owned by gentlemen who were trying to make money. And the city having passed an ordinance requiring them to give transfers, they had fallen into a rage; and first they had made a rule that transfers could be had only when the fare was paid; and later, growing still uglier, they had made another—that the passenger must ask for the transfer, the conductor was not allowed to offer it. Now Ona had been told that she was to get a transfer; but it was not her way to speak up, and so she merely waited, following the conductor about with her eyes, wondering when he would think of her. When at last the time came for her to get out, she asked for the transfer, and was refused. Not knowing what to make of this, she began to argue with the conductor, in a language of which he did not understand a word. After warning her several times, he pulled the bell and the car went on—at which Ona burst into tears. At the next corner she got out, of course; and as she had no more money, she had to walk the rest of the way to the yards in the pouring rain. And so all day long she sat shivering, and came home at night with her teeth chattering and pains in her head and back. For two weeks afterward she suffered cruelly—and yet every day she had to drag herself to her work. The forewoman was especially severe with Ona, because she believed that she was obstinate on account of having been refused a holiday the day after her wedding. Ona had an idea that her “forelady” did not like to have her girls marry—perhaps because she was old and ugly and unmarried herself.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000419\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000419\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000420\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000420\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>There were many such dangers, in which the odds were all against them.

How could they know that the pale-blue milk that they bought around the corner was watered, and doctored with formaldehyde besides? When the children were not well at home, Teta Elzbieta would gather herbs and cure them; now she was obliged to go to the drugstore and buy extracts—and how was she to know that they were all adulterated? How could they find out that their tea and coffee, their sugar and flour, had been doctored; that their canned peas had been colored with copper salts, and their fruit jams with aniline dyes? And even if they had known it, what good would it have done them, since there was no place within miles of them where any other sort was to be had? The bitter winter was coming, and they had to save money to get more clothing and bedding; but it would not matter in the least how much they saved, they could not get anything to keep them warm. All the clothing that was to be had in the stores was made of cotton and shoddy, which is made by tearing old clothes to pieces and weaving the fiber again. If they paid higher prices, they might get frills and fanciness, or be cheated; but genuine quality they could not obtain for love nor money. A young friend of Szedvilas’, recently come from abroad, had become a clerk in a store on Ashland Avenue, and he narrated with glee a trick that had been played upon an unsuspecting countryman by his boss. The customer had desired to purchase an alarm clock, and the boss had shown him two exactly similar, telling him that the price of one was a dollar and of the other a dollar seventy-five. Upon being asked what the difference was, the man had wound up the first halfway and the second all the way, and showed the customer how the latter made twice as much noise; upon which the customer remarked that he was a sound sleeper, and had better take the more expensive clock!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000421\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000421\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000422\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000422\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"letter\\\">There is a poet who sings that</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000423\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000423\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000424\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000424\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"poem\\\">“Deeper their heart grows and nobler their bearing,<br>\\nWhose youth in the fires of anguish hath died.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000425\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000425\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000426\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000426\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"noindent\\\">But it was not likely that he had reference to the kind of anguish that comes with destitution, that is so endlessly bitter and cruel, and yet so sordid and petty, so ugly, so humiliating—unredeemed by the slightest touch of dignity or even of pathos. It is a kind of anguish that poets have not commonly dealt with; its very words are not admitted into the vocabulary of poets—the details of it cannot be told in polite society at all. How, for instance, could any one expect to excite sympathy among lovers of good literature by telling how a family found their home alive with vermin, and of all the suffering and inconvenience and humiliation they were put to, and the hard-earned money they spent, in efforts to get rid of them? After long hesitation and uncertainty they paid twenty-five cents for a big package of insect powder—a patent preparation which chanced to be ninety-five per cent gypsum, a harmless earth which had cost about two cents to prepare. Of course it had not the least effect, except upon a few roaches which had the misfortune to drink water after eating it, and so got their inwards set in a coating of plaster of Paris. The family, having no idea of this, and no more money to throw away, had nothing to do but give up and submit to one more misery for the rest of their days.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000427\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000427\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000428\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000428\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then there was old Antanas. The winter came, and the place where he worked was a dark, unheated cellar, where you could see your breath all day, and where your fingers sometimes tried to freeze. So the old man’s cough grew every day worse, until there came a time when it hardly ever stopped, and he had become a nuisance about the place. Then, too, a still more dreadful thing happened to him; he worked in a place where his feet were soaked in chemicals, and it was not long before they had eaten through his new boots. Then sores began to break out on his feet, and grow worse and worse. Whether it was that his blood was bad, or there had been a cut, he could not say; but he asked the men about it, and learned that it was a regular thing—it was the saltpeter. Every one felt it, sooner or later, and then it was all up with him, at least for that sort of work. The sores would never heal—in the end his toes would drop off, if he did not quit. Yet old Antanas would not quit; he saw the suffering of his family, and he remembered what it had cost him to get a job. So he tied up his feet, and went on limping about and coughing, until at last he fell to pieces, all at once and in a heap, like the One-Horse Shay. They carried him to a dry place and laid him on the floor, and that night two of the men helped him home. The poor old man was put to bed, and though he tried it every morning until the end, he never could get up again. He would lie there and cough and cough, day and night, wasting away to a mere skeleton. There came a time when there was so little flesh on him that the bones began to poke through—which was a horrible thing to see or even to think of. And one night he had a choking fit, and a little river of blood came out of his mouth. The family, wild with terror, sent for a doctor, and paid half a dollar to be told that there was nothing to be done. Mercifully the doctor did not say this so that the old man could hear, for he was still clinging to the faith that tomorrow or next day he would be better, and could go back to his job. The company had sent word to him that they would keep it for him—or rather Jurgis had bribed one of the men to come one Sunday afternoon and say they had. Dede Antanas continued to believe it, while three more hemorrhages came; and then at last one morning they found him stiff and cold. Things were not going well with them then, and though it nearly broke Teta Elzbieta’s heart, they were forced to dispense with nearly all the decencies of a funeral; they had only a hearse, and one hack for the women and children; and Jurgis, who was learning things fast, spent all Sunday making a bargain for these, and he made it in the presence of witnesses, so that when the man tried to charge him for all sorts of incidentals, he did not have to pay. For twenty-five years old Antanas Rudkus and his son had dwelt in the forest together, and it was hard to part in this way; perhaps it was just as well that Jurgis had to give all his attention to the task of having a funeral without being bankrupted, and so had no time to indulge in memories and grief.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000429\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000429\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000430\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000430\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Now the dreadful winter was come upon them.

Blizzards and cold made no difference to them, they were always on hand; they were on hand two hours before the sun rose, an hour before the work began. Sometimes their faces froze, sometimes their feet and their hands; sometimes they froze all together—but still they came, for they had no other place to go. One day Durham advertised in the paper for two hundred men to cut ice; and all that day the homeless and starving of the city came trudging through the snow from all over its two hundred square miles. That night forty score of them crowded into the station house of the stockyards district—they filled the rooms, sleeping in each other’s laps, toboggan fashion, and they piled on top of each other in the corridors, till the police shut the doors and left some to freeze outside. On the morrow, before daybreak, there were three thousand at Durham’s, and the police reserves had to be sent for to quell the riot.

Some would ride in the cars, if the cars were running; but when you are making only five cents an hour, as was little Stanislovas, you do not like to spend that much to ride two miles. The children would come to the yards with great shawls about their ears, and so tied up that you could hardly find them—and still there would be accidents. One bitter morning in February the little boy who worked at the lard machine with Stanislovas came about an hour late, and screaming with pain. They unwrapped him, and a man began vigorously rubbing his ears; and as they were frozen stiff, it took only two or three rubs to break them short off. As a result of this, little Stanislovas conceived a terror of the cold that was almost a mania. Every morning, when it came time to start for the yards, he would begin to cry and protest. Nobody knew quite how to manage him, for threats did no good—it seemed to be something that he could not control, and they feared sometimes that he would go into convulsions. In the end it had to be arranged that he always went with Jurgis, and came home with him again; and often, when the snow was deep, the man would carry him the whole way on his shoulders. Sometimes Jurgis would be working until late at night, and then it was pitiful, for there was no place for the little fellow to wait, save in the doorways or in a corner of the killing beds, and he would all but fall asleep there, and freeze to death.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000437\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000437\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000438\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000438\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>There was no heat upon the killing beds; the men might exactly as well have worked out of doors all winter. For that matter, there was very little heat anywhere in the building, except in the cooking rooms and such places—and it was the men who worked in these who ran the most risk of all, because whenever they had to pass to another room they had to go through ice-cold corridors, and sometimes with nothing on above the waist except a sleeveless undershirt. On the killing beds you were apt to be covered with blood, and it would freeze solid; if you leaned against a pillar, you would freeze to that, and if you put your hand upon the blade of your knife, you would run a chance of leaving your skin on it. The men would tie up their feet in newspapers and old sacks, and these would be soaked in blood and frozen, and then soaked again, and so on, until by nighttime a man would be walking on great lumps the size of the feet of an elephant. Now and then, when the bosses were not looking, you would see them plunging their feet and ankles into the steaming hot carcass of the steer, or darting across the room to the hot-water jets. The cruelest thing of all was that nearly all of them—all of those who used knives—were unable to wear gloves, and their arms would be white with frost and their hands would grow numb, and then of course there would be accidents. Also the air would be full of steam, from the hot water and the hot blood, so that you could not see five feet before you; and then, with men rushing about at the speed they kept up on the killing beds, and all with butcher knives, like razors, in their hands—well, it was to be counted as a wonder that there were not more men slaughtered than cattle.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000439\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000439\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000440\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000440\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And yet all this inconvenience they might have put up with, if only it had not been for one thing—if only there had been some place where they might eat.

Walk in.” “Bean soup and stewed lamb. Welcome.” All of these things were printed in many languages, as were also the names of the resorts, which were infinite in their variety and appeal. There was the “Home Circle” and the “Cosey Corner”; there were “Firesides” and “Hearthstones” and “Pleasure Palaces” and “Wonderlands” and “Dream Castles” and “Love’s Delights.” Whatever else they were called, they were sure to be called “Union Headquarters,” and to hold out a welcome to workingmen; and there was always a warm stove, and a chair near it, and some friends to laugh and talk with. There was only one condition attached,—you must drink. If you went in not intending to drink, you would be put out in no time, and if you were slow about going, like as not you would get your head split open with a beer bottle in the bargain. But all of the men understood the convention and drank; they believed that by it they were getting something for nothing—for they did not need to take more than one drink, and upon the strength of it they might fill themselves up with a good hot dinner. This did not always work out in practice, however, for there was pretty sure to be a friend who would treat you, and then you would have to treat him. Then some one else would come in—and, anyhow, a few drinks were good for a man who worked hard. As he went back he did not shiver so, he had more courage for his task; the deadly brutalizing monotony of it did not afflict him so,—he had ideas while he worked, and took a more cheerful view of his circumstances. On the way home, however, the shivering was apt to come on him again; and so he would have to stop once or twice to warm up against the cruel cold. As there were hot things to eat in this saloon too, he might get home late to his supper, or he might not get home at all. And then his wife might set out to look for him, and she too would feel the cold; and perhaps she would have some of the children with her—and so a whole family would drift into drinking, as the current of a river drifts downstream. As if to complete the chain, the packers all paid their men in checks, refusing all requests to pay in coin; and where in Packingtown could a man go to have his check cashed but to a saloon, where he could pay for the favor by spending a part of the money?</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000443\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000443\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000444\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000444\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>From all of these things Jurgis was saved because of Ona. He never would take but the one drink at noontime; and so he got the reputation of being a surly fellow, and was not quite welcome at the saloons, and had to drift about from one to another. Then at night he would go straight home, helping Ona and Stanislovas, or often putting the former on a car. And when he got home perhaps he would have to trudge several blocks, and come staggering back through the snowdrifts with a bag of coal upon his shoulder. Home was not a very attractive place—at least not this winter. They had only been able to buy one stove, and this was a small one, and proved not big enough to warm even the kitchen in the bitterest weather. This made it hard for Teta Elzbieta all day, and for the children when they could not get to school. At night they would sit huddled round this stove, while they ate their supper off their laps; and then Jurgis and Jonas would smoke a pipe, after which they would all crawl into their beds to get warm, after putting out the fire to save the coal. Then they would have some frightful experiences with the cold. They would sleep with all their clothes on, including their overcoats, and put over them all the bedding and spare clothing they owned; the children would sleep all crowded into one bed, and yet even so they could not keep warm. The outside ones would be shivering and sobbing, crawling over the others and trying to get down into the center, and causing a fight. This old house with the leaky weatherboards was a very different thing from their cabins at home, with great thick walls plastered inside and outside with mud; and the cold which came upon them was a living thing, a demon-presence in the room. They would waken in the midnight hours, when everything was black; perhaps they would hear it yelling outside, or perhaps there would be deathlike stillness—and that would be worse yet. They could feel the cold as it crept in through the cracks, reaching out for them with its icy, death-dealing fingers; and they would crouch and cower, and try to hide from it, all in vain. It would come, and it would come; a grisly thing, a specter born in the black caverns of terror; a power primeval, cosmic, shadowing the tortures of the lost souls flung out to chaos and destruction. It was cruel iron-hard; and hour after hour they would cringe in its grasp, alone, alone. There would be no one to hear them if they cried out; there would be no help, no mercy. And so on until morning—when they would go out to another day of toil, a little weaker, a little nearer to the time when it would be their turn to be shaken from the tree.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000445\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000445\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000446\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000446\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000447\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000447\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000448\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000448\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000449\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000449\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Yet even by this deadly winter the germ of hope was not to be kept from sprouting in their hearts.

There was no place to entertain company except in the kitchen, in the midst of the family, and Tamoszius would sit there with his hat between his knees, never saying more than half a dozen words at a time, and turning red in the face before he managed to say those; until finally Jurgis would clap him upon the back, in his hearty way, crying, “Come now, brother, give us a tune.” And then Tamoszius’ face would light up and he would get out his fiddle, tuck it under his chin, and play. And forthwith the soul of him would flame up and become eloquent—it was almost an impropriety, for all the while his gaze would be fixed upon Marija’s face, until she would begin to turn red and lower her eyes.

People paid Tamoszius big money to come and make music on state occasions; and also they would invite him to parties and festivals, knowing well that he was too good-natured to come without his fiddle, and that having brought it, he could be made to play while others danced. Once he made bold to ask Marija to accompany him to such a party, and Marija accepted, to his great delight—after which he never went anywhere without her, while if the celebration were given by friends of his, he would invite the rest of the family also.

She was compelled, at these parties, to spend most of her time at the refreshment table, for she could not dance with anybody except other women and very old men; Tamoszius was of an excitable temperament, and afflicted with a frantic jealousy, and any unmarried man who ventured to put his arm about the ample waist of Marija would be certain to throw the orchestra out of tune.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000454\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000454\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000455\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000455\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was a great help to a person who had to toil all the week to be able to look forward to some such relaxation as this on Saturday nights.

There were many days when the total was less than half an hour, and others when there was none at all. The general average was six hours a day, which meant for Jurgis about six dollars a week; and this six hours of work would be done after standing on the killing bed till one o’clock, or perhaps even three or four o’clock, in the afternoon. Like as not there would come a rush of cattle at the very end of the day, which the men would have to dispose of before they went home, often working by electric light till nine or ten, or even twelve or one o’clock, and without a single instant for a bite of supper. The men were at the mercy of the cattle. Perhaps the buyers would be holding off for better prices—if they could scare the shippers into thinking that they meant to buy nothing that day, they could get their own terms. For some reason the cost of fodder for cattle in the yards was much above the market price—and you were not allowed to bring your own fodder! Then, too, a number of cars were apt to arrive late in the day, now that the roads were blocked with snow, and the packers would buy their cattle that night, to get them cheaper, and then would come into play their ironclad rule, that all cattle must be killed the same day they were bought. There was no use kicking about this—there had been one delegation after another to see the packers about it, only to be told that it was the rule, and that there was not the slightest chance of its ever being altered.

For after all the hard work a man did, he was paid for only part of it. Jurgis had once been among those who scoffed at the idea of these huge concerns cheating; and so now he could appreciate the bitter irony of the fact that it was precisely their size which enabled them to do it with impunity. One of the rules on the killing beds was that a man who was one minute late was docked an hour; and this was economical, for he was made to work the balance of the hour—he was not allowed to stand round and wait. And on the other hand if he came ahead of time he got no pay for that—though often the bosses would start up the gang ten or fifteen minutes before the whistle. And this same custom they carried over to the end of the day; they did not pay for any fraction of an hour—for “broken time.” A man might work full fifty minutes, but if there was no work to fill out the hour, there was no pay for him. Thus the end of every day was a sort of lottery—a struggle, all but breaking into open war between the bosses and the men, the former trying to rush a job through and the latter trying to stretch it out. Jurgis blamed the bosses for this, though the truth to be told it was not always their fault; for the packers kept them frightened for their lives—and when one was in danger of falling behind the standard, what was easier than to catch up by making the gang work awhile “for the church”? This was a savage witticism the men had, which Jurgis had to have explained to him. Old man Jones was great on missions and such things, and so whenever they were doing some particularly disreputable job, the men would wink at each other and say, “Now we’re working for the church!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000474\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000474\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000475\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000475\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>One of the consequences of all these things was that Jurgis was no longer perplexed when he heard men talk of fighting for their rights. He felt like fighting now himself; and when the Irish delegate of the butcher-helpers’ union came to him a second time, he received him in a far different spirit. A wonderful idea it now seemed to Jurgis, this of the men—that by combining they might be able to make a stand and conquer the packers! Jurgis wondered who had first thought of it; and when he was told that it was a common thing for men to do in America, he got the first inkling of a meaning in the phrase “a free country.” The delegate explained to him how it depended upon their being able to get every man to join and stand by the organization, and so Jurgis signified that he was willing to do his share. Before another month was by, all the working members of his family had union cards, and wore their union buttons conspicuously and with pride. For fully a week they were quite blissfully happy, thinking that belonging to a union meant an end to all their troubles.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000476\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000476\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000477\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000477\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But only ten days after she had joined, Marija’s canning factory closed down, and that blow quite staggered them.

Jurgis had gone with the desire to get into an inconspicuous corner and see what was done; but this attitude of silent and open-eyed attention had marked him out for a victim. Tommy Finnegan was a little Irishman, with big staring eyes and a wild aspect, a “hoister” by trade, and badly cracked. Somewhere back in the far-distant past Tommy Finnegan had had a strange experience, and the burden of it rested upon him. All the balance of his life he had done nothing but try to make it understood. When he talked he caught his victim by the buttonhole, and his face kept coming closer and closer—which was trying, because his teeth were so bad. Jurgis did not mind that, only he was frightened. The method of operation of the higher intelligences was Tom Finnegan’s theme, and he desired to find out if Jurgis had ever considered that the representation of things in their present similarity might be altogether unintelligible upon a more elevated plane. There were assuredly wonderful mysteries about the developing of these things; and then, becoming confidential, Mr. Finnegan proceeded to tell of some discoveries of his own. “If ye have iver had onything to do wid shperrits,” said he, and looked inquiringly at Jurgis, who kept shaking his head. “Niver mind, niver mind,” continued the other, “but their influences may be operatin’ upon ye; it’s shure as I’m tellin’ ye, it’s them that has the reference to the immejit surroundin’s that has the most of power. It was vouchsafed to me in me youthful days to be acquainted with shperrits” and so Tommy Finnegan went on, expounding a system of philosophy, while the perspiration came out on Jurgis’ forehead, so great was his agitation and embarrassment. In the end one of the men, seeing his plight, came over and rescued him; but it was some time before he was able to find any one to explain things to him, and meanwhile his fear lest the strange little Irishman should get him cornered again was enough to keep him dodging about the room the whole evening.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000480\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000480\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000481\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000481\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>He never missed a meeting, however. He had picked up a few words of English by this time, and friends would help him to understand. They were often very turbulent meetings, with half a dozen men declaiming at once, in as many dialects of English; but the speakers were all desperately in earnest, and Jurgis was in earnest too, for he understood that a fight was on, and that it was his fight. Since the time of his disillusionment, Jurgis had sworn to trust no man, except in his own family; but here he discovered that he had brothers in affliction, and allies. Their one chance for life was in union, and so the struggle became a kind of crusade. Jurgis had always been a member of the church, because it was the right thing to be, but the church had never touched him, he left all that for the women. Here, however, was a new religion—one that did touch him, that took hold of every fiber of him; and with all the zeal and fury of a convert he went out as a missionary. There were many nonunion men among the Lithuanians, and with these he would labor and wrestle in prayer, trying to show them the right. Sometimes they would be obstinate and refuse to see it, and Jurgis, alas, was not always patient! He forgot how he himself had been blind, a short time ago—after the fashion of all crusaders since the original ones, who set out to spread the gospel of Brotherhood by force of arms.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000482\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000482\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000483\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000483\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000484\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000484\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER IX</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000485\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000485\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000486\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000486\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>One of the first consequences of the discovery of the union was that Jurgis became desirous of learning English.

In other words, in the union Jurgis learned to talk politics. In the place where he had come from there had not been any politics—in Russia one thought of the government as an affliction like the lightning and the hail. “Duck, little brother, duck,” the wise old peasants would whisper; “everything passes away.” And when Jurgis had first come to America he had supposed that it was the same.

In the first place, it would not cost him anything, and it would get him half a day off, with his pay just the same; and then when election time came he would be able to vote—and there was something in that. Jurgis was naturally glad to accept, and so the night watchman said a few words to the boss, and he was excused for the rest of the day. When, later on, he wanted a holiday to get married he could not get it; and as for a holiday with pay just the same—what power had wrought that miracle heaven only knew! However, he went with the man, who picked up several other newly landed immigrants, Poles, Lithuanians, and Slovaks, and took them all outside, where stood a great four-horse tallyho coach, with fifteen or twenty men already in it. It was a fine chance to see the sights of the city, and the party had a merry time, with plenty of beer handed up from inside. So they drove downtown and stopped before an imposing granite building, in which they interviewed an official, who had the papers all ready, with only the names to be filled in. So each man in turn took an oath of which he did not understand a word, and then was presented with a handsome ornamented document with a big red seal and the shield of the United States upon it, and was told that he had become a citizen of the Republic and the equal of the President himself.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000491\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000491\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000492\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000492\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>A month or two later Jurgis had another interview with this same man, who told him where to go to “register.” And then finally, when election day came, the packing houses posted a notice that men who desired to vote might remain away until nine that morning, and the same night watchman took Jurgis and the rest of his flock into the back room of a saloon, and showed each of them where and how to mark a ballot, and then gave each two dollars, and took them to the polling place, where there was a policeman on duty especially to see that they got through all right.

The officials who ruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there were two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the one got the office which bought the most votes. Now and then, the election was very close, and that was the time the poor man came in. In the stockyards this was only in national and state elections, for in local elections the Democratic Party always carried everything. The ruler of the district was therefore the Democratic boss, a little Irishman named Mike Scully. Scully held an important party office in the state, and bossed even the mayor of the city, it was said; it was his boast that he carried the stockyards in his pocket. He was an enormously rich man—he had a hand in all the big graft in the neighborhood. It was Scully, for instance, who owned that dump which Jurgis and Ona had seen the first day of their arrival. Not only did he own the dump, but he owned the brick factory as well, and first he took out the clay and made it into bricks, and then he had the city bring garbage to fill up the hole, so that he could build houses to sell to the people. Then, too, he sold the bricks to the city, at his own price, and the city came and got them in its own wagons. And also he owned the other hole near by, where the stagnant water was; and it was he who cut the ice and sold it; and what was more, if the men told truth, he had not had to pay any taxes for the water, and he had built the ice-house out of city lumber, and had not had to pay anything for that. The newspapers had got hold of that story, and there had been a scandal; but Scully had hired somebody to confess and take all the blame, and then skip the country. It was said, too, that he had built his brick-kiln in the same way, and that the workmen were on the city payroll while they did it; however, one had to press closely to get these things out of the men, for it was not their business, and Mike Scully was a good man to stand in with. A note signed by him was equal to a job any time at the packing houses; and also he employed a good many men himself, and worked them only eight hours a day, and paid them the highest wages. This gave him many friends—all of whom he had gotten together into the “War Whoop League,” whose clubhouse you might see just outside of the yards. It was the biggest clubhouse, and the biggest club, in all Chicago; and they had prizefights every now and then, and cockfights and even dogfights. The policemen in the district all belonged to the league, and instead of suppressing the fights, they sold tickets for them. The man that had taken Jurgis to be naturalized was one of these “Indians,” as they were called; and on election day there would be hundreds of them out, and all with big wads of money in their pockets and free drinks at every saloon in the district. That was another thing, the men said—all the saloon-keepers had to be “Indians,” and to put up on demand, otherwise they could not do business on Sundays, nor have any gambling at all. In the same way Scully had all the jobs in the fire department at his disposal, and all the rest of the city graft in the stockyards district; he was building a block of flats somewhere up on Ashland Avenue, and the man who was overseeing it for him was drawing pay as a city inspector of sewers. The city inspector of water pipes had been dead and buried for over a year, but somebody was still drawing his pay. The city inspector of sidewalks was a barkeeper at the War Whoop Cafe—and maybe he could make it uncomfortable for any tradesman who did not stand in with Scully!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000495\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000495\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000496\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000496\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Even the packers were in awe of him, so the men said. It gave them pleasure to believe this, for Scully stood as the people’s man, and boasted of it boldly when election day came. The packers had wanted a bridge at Ashland Avenue, but they had not been able to get it till they had seen Scully; and it was the same with “Bubbly Creek,” which the city had threatened to make the packers cover over, till Scully had come to their aid. “Bubbly Creek” is an arm of the Chicago River, and forms the southern boundary of the yards: all the drainage of the square mile of packing houses empties into it, so that it is really a great open sewer a hundred or two feet wide. One long arm of it is blind, and the filth stays there forever and a day. The grease and chemicals that are poured into it undergo all sorts of strange transformations, which are the cause of its name; it is constantly in motion, as if huge fish were feeding in it, or great leviathans disporting themselves in its depths. Bubbles of carbonic acid gas will rise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide. Here and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding, and many times an unwary stranger has started to stroll across, and vanished temporarily. The packers used to leave the creek that way, till every now and then the surface would catch on fire and burn furiously, and the fire department would have to come and put it out. Once, however, an ingenious stranger came and started to gather this filth in scows, to make lard out of; then the packers took the cue, and got out an injunction to stop him, and afterward gathered it themselves. The banks of “Bubbly Creek” are plastered thick with hairs, and this also the packers gather and clean.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000497\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000497\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000498\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000498\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And there were things even stranger than this, according to the gossip of the men. The packers had secret mains, through which they stole billions of gallons of the city’s water. The newspapers had been full of this scandal—once there had even been an investigation, and an actual uncovering of the pipes; but nobody had been punished, and the thing went right on. And then there was the condemned meat industry, with its endless horrors. The people of Chicago saw the government inspectors in Packingtown, and they all took that to mean that they were protected from diseased meat; they did not understand that these hundred and sixty-three inspectors had been appointed at the request of the packers, and that they were paid by the United States government to certify that all the diseased meat was kept in the state. They had no authority beyond that; for the inspection of meat to be sold in the city and state the whole force in Packingtown consisted of three henchmen of the local political machine!<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000500\\\"><sup>[2]</sup></$link> And shortly afterward one of these, a physician, made the discovery that the carcasses of steers which had been condemned as tubercular by the government inspectors, and which therefore contained ptomaines, which are deadly poisons, were left upon an open platform and carted away to be sold in the city; and so he insisted that these carcasses be treated with an injection of kerosene—and was ordered to resign the same week! So indignant were the packers that they went farther, and compelled the mayor to abolish the whole bureau of inspection; so that since then there has not been even a pretense of any interference with the graft. There was said to be two thousand dollars a week hush money from the tubercular steers alone; and as much again from the hogs which had died of cholera on the trains, and which you might see any day being loaded into boxcars and hauled away to a place called Globe, in Indiana, where they made a fancy grade of lard.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000499\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000499\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000500\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000500\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000498\\\">[2]</$link> Rules and Regulations for the Inspection of Livestock and Their Products.

It seemed as if every time you met a person from a new department, you heard of new swindles and new crimes. There was, for instance, a Lithuanian who was a cattle butcher for the plant where Marija had worked, which killed meat for canning only; and to hear this man describe the animals which came to his place would have been worthwhile for a Dante or a Zola. It seemed that they must have agencies all over the country, to hunt out old and crippled and diseased cattle to be canned. There were cattle which had been fed on “whisky-malt,” the refuse of the breweries, and had become what the men called “steerly”—which means covered with boils. It was a nasty job killing these, for when you plunged your knife into them they would burst and splash foul-smelling stuff into your face; and when a man’s sleeves were smeared with blood, and his hands steeped in it, how was he ever to wipe his face, or to clear his eyes so that he could see? It was stuff such as this that made the “embalmed beef” that had killed several times as many United States soldiers as all the bullets of the Spaniards; only the army beef, besides, was not fresh canned, it was old stuff that had been lying for years in the cellars.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000503\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000503\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000504\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000504\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then one Sunday evening, Jurgis sat puffing his pipe by the kitchen stove, and talking with an old fellow whom Jonas had introduced, and who worked in the canning rooms at Durham’s; and so Jurgis learned a few things about the great and only Durham canned goods, which had become a national institution. They were regular alchemists at Durham’s; they advertised a mushroom-catsup, and the men who made it did not know what a mushroom looked like. They advertised “potted chicken,”—and it was like the boardinghouse soup of the comic papers, through which a chicken had walked with rubbers on. Perhaps they had a secret process for making chickens chemically—who knows? said Jurgis’ friend; the things that went into the mixture were tripe, and the fat of pork, and beef suet, and hearts of beef, and finally the waste ends of veal, when they had any. They put these up in several grades, and sold them at several prices; but the contents of the cans all came out of the same hopper. And then there was “potted game” and “potted grouse,” “potted ham,” and “deviled ham”—de-vyled, as the men called it. “De-vyled” ham was made out of the waste ends of smoked beef that were too small to be sliced by the machines; and also tripe, dyed with chemicals so that it would not show white; and trimmings of hams and corned beef; and potatoes, skins and all; and finally the hard cartilaginous gullets of beef, after the tongues had been cut out. All this ingenious mixture was ground up and flavored with spices to make it taste like something. Anybody who could invent a new imitation had been sure of a fortune from old Durham, said Jurgis’ informant; but it was hard to think of anything new in a place where so many sharp wits had been at work for so long; where men welcomed tuberculosis in the cattle they were feeding, because it made them fatten more quickly; and where they bought up all the old rancid butter left over in the grocery stores of a continent, and “oxidized” it by a forced-air process, to take away the odor, rechurned it with skim milk, and sold it in bricks in the cities! Up to a year or two ago it had been the custom to kill horses in the yards—ostensibly for fertilizer; but after long agitation the newspapers had been able to make the public realize that the horses were being canned. Now it was against the law to kill horses in Packingtown, and the law was really complied with—for the present, at any rate. Any day, however, one might see sharp-horned and shaggy-haired creatures running with the sheep and yet what a job you would have to get the public to believe that a good part of what it buys for lamb and mutton is really goat’s flesh!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000505\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000505\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000506\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000506\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>There was another interesting set of statistics that a person might have gathered in Packingtown—those of the various afflictions of the workers.

The workers in each of them had their own peculiar diseases.

Let a man so much as scrape his finger pushing a truck in the pickle rooms, and he might have a sore that would put him out of the world; all the joints in his fingers might be eaten by the acid, one by one. Of the butchers and floorsmen, the beef-boners and trimmers, and all those who used knives, you could scarcely find a person who had the use of his thumb; time and time again the base of it had been slashed, till it was a mere lump of flesh against which the man pressed the knife to hold it. The hands of these men would be criss-crossed with cuts, until you could no longer pretend to count them or to trace them. They would have no nails,—they had worn them off pulling hides; their knuckles were swollen so that their fingers spread out like a fan. There were men who worked in the cooking rooms, in the midst of steam and sickening odors, by artificial light; in these rooms the germs of tuberculosis might live for two years, but the supply was renewed every hour. There were the beef-luggers, who carried two-hundred-pound quarters into the refrigerator-cars; a fearful kind of work, that began at four o’clock in the morning, and that wore out the most powerful men in a few years. There were those who worked in the chilling rooms, and whose special disease was rheumatism; the time limit that a man could work in the chilling rooms was said to be five years. There were the wool-pluckers, whose hands went to pieces even sooner than the hands of the pickle men; for the pelts of the sheep had to be painted with acid to loosen the wool, and then the pluckers had to pull out this wool with their bare hands, till the acid had eaten their fingers off. There were those who made the tins for the canned meat; and their hands, too, were a maze of cuts, and each cut represented a chance for blood poisoning. Some worked at the stamping machines, and it was very seldom that one could work long there at the pace that was set, and not give out and forget himself and have a part of his hand chopped off. There were the “hoisters,” as they were called, whose task it was to press the lever which lifted the dead cattle off the floor. They ran along upon a rafter, peering down through the damp and the steam; and as old Durham’s architects had not built the killing room for the convenience of the hoisters, at every few feet they would have to stoop under a beam, say four feet above the one they ran on; which got them into the habit of stooping, so that in a few years they would be walking like chimpanzees. Worst of any, however, were the fertilizer men, and those who served in the cooking rooms. These people could not be shown to the visitor,—for the odor of a fertilizer man would scare any ordinary visitor at a hundred yards, and as for the other men, who worked in tank rooms full of steam, and in some of which there were open vats near the level of the floor, their peculiar trouble was that they fell into the vats; and when they were fished out, there was never enough of them left to be worth exhibiting,—sometimes they would be overlooked for days, till all but the bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham’s Pure Leaf Lard!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000509\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000509\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000510\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000510\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000511\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000511\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER X</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000512\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000512\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000513\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000513\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>During the early part of the winter the family had had money enough to live and a little over to pay their debts with; but when the earnings of Jurgis fell from nine or ten dollars a week to five or six, there was no longer anything to spare.

Once their water pipes froze and burst; and when, in their ignorance, they thawed them out, they had a terrifying flood in their house. It happened while the men were away, and poor Elzbieta rushed out into the street screaming for help, for she did not even know whether the flood could be stopped, or whether they were ruined for life. It was nearly as bad as the latter, they found in the end, for the plumber charged them seventy-five cents an hour, and seventy-five cents for another man who had stood and watched him, and included all the time the two had been going and coming, and also a charge for all sorts of material and extras. And then again, when they went to pay their January’s installment on the house, the agent terrified them by asking them if they had had the insurance attended to yet. In answer to their inquiry he showed them a clause in the deed which provided that they were to keep the house insured for one thousand dollars, as soon as the present policy ran out, which would happen in a few days. Poor Elzbieta, upon whom again fell the blow, demanded how much it would cost them. Seven dollars, the man said; and that night came Jurgis, grim and determined, requesting that the agent would be good enough to inform him, once for all, as to all the expenses they were liable for. The deed was signed now, he said, with sarcasm proper to the new way of life he had learned—the deed was signed, and so the agent had no longer anything to gain by keeping quiet. And Jurgis looked the fellow squarely in the eye, and so the fellow wasted no time in conventional protests, but read him the deed. They would have to renew the insurance every year; they would have to pay the taxes, about ten dollars a year; they would have to pay the water tax, about six dollars a year—(Jurgis silently resolved to shut off the hydrant). This, besides the interest and the monthly installments, would be all—unless by chance the city should happen to decide to put in a sewer or to lay a sidewalk. Yes, said the agent, they would have to have these, whether they wanted them or not, if the city said so. The sewer would cost them about twenty-two dollars, and the sidewalk fifteen if it were wood, twenty-five if it were cement.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000518\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000518\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000519\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000519\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So Jurgis went home again; it was a relief to know the worst, at any rate, so that he could no more be surprised by fresh demands.

Then, too, the warm weather brought trials of its own; each season had its trials, as they found. In the spring there were cold rains, that turned the streets into canals and bogs; the mud would be so deep that wagons would sink up to the hubs, so that half a dozen horses could not move them. Then, of course, it was impossible for any one to get to work with dry feet; and this was bad for men that were poorly clad and shod, and still worse for women and children. Later came midsummer, with the stifling heat, when the dingy killing beds of Durham’s became a very purgatory; one time, in a single day, three men fell dead from sunstroke. All day long the rivers of hot blood poured forth, until, with the sun beating down, and the air motionless, the stench was enough to knock a man over; all the old smells of a generation would be drawn out by this heat—for there was never any washing of the walls and rafters and pillars, and they were caked with the filth of a lifetime. The men who worked on the killing beds would come to reek with foulness, so that you could smell one of them fifty feet away; there was simply no such thing as keeping decent, the most careful man gave it up in the end, and wallowed in uncleanness. There was not even a place where a man could wash his hands, and the men ate as much raw blood as food at dinnertime. When they were at work they could not even wipe off their faces—they were as helpless as newly born babes in that respect; and it may seem like a small matter, but when the sweat began to run down their necks and tickle them, or a fly to bother them, it was a torture like being burned alive. Whether it was the slaughterhouses or the dumps that were responsible, one could not say, but with the hot weather there descended upon Packingtown a veritable Egyptian plague of flies; there could be no describing this—the houses would be black with them. There was no escaping; you might provide all your doors and windows with screens, but their buzzing outside would be like the swarming of bees, and whenever you opened the door they would rush in as if a storm of wind were driving them.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000522\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000522\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000523\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000523\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Perhaps the summertime suggests to you thoughts of the country, visions of green fields and mountains and sparkling lakes. It had no such suggestion for the people in the yards. The great packing machine ground on remorselessly, without thinking of green fields; and the men and women and children who were part of it never saw any green thing, not even a flower. Four or five miles to the east of them lay the blue waters of Lake Michigan; but for all the good it did them it might have been as far away as the Pacific Ocean. They had only Sundays, and then they were too tired to walk. They were tied to the great packing machine, and tied to it for life. The managers and superintendents and clerks of Packingtown were all recruited from another class, and never from the workers; they scorned the workers, the very meanest of them. A poor devil of a bookkeeper who had been working in Durham’s for twenty years at a salary of six dollars a week, and might work there for twenty more and do no better, would yet consider himself a gentleman, as far removed as the poles from the most skilled worker on the killing beds; he would dress differently, and live in another part of the town, and come to work at a different hour of the day, and in every way make sure that he never rubbed elbows with a laboring man. Perhaps this was due to the repulsiveness of the work; at any rate, the people who worked with their hands were a class apart, and were made to feel it.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000524\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000524\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000525\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000525\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the late spring the canning factory started up again, and so once more Marija was heard to sing, and the love-music of Tamoszius took on a less melancholy tone.

Marija insisted that it was because of her activity in the union. The packers, of course, had spies in all the unions, and in addition they made a practice of buying up a certain number of the union officials, as many as they thought they needed. So every week they received reports as to what was going on, and often they knew things before the members of the union knew them. Any one who was considered to be dangerous by them would find that he was not a favorite with his boss; and Marija had been a great hand for going after the foreign people and preaching to them. However that might be, the known facts were that a few weeks before the factory closed, Marija had been cheated out of her pay for three hundred cans. The girls worked at a long table, and behind them walked a woman with pencil and notebook, keeping count of the number they finished. This woman was, of course, only human, and sometimes made mistakes; when this happened, there was no redress—if on Saturday you got less money than you had earned, you had to make the best of it. But Marija did not understand this, and made a disturbance. Marija’s disturbances did not mean anything, and while she had known only Lithuanian and Polish, they had done no harm, for people only laughed at her and made her cry. But now Marija was able to call names in English, and so she got the woman who made the mistake to disliking her. Probably, as Marija claimed, she made mistakes on purpose after that; at any rate, she made them, and the third time it happened Marija went on the warpath and took the matter first to the forelady, and when she got no satisfaction there, to the superintendent. This was unheard-of presumption, but the superintendent said he would see about it, which Marija took to mean that she was going to get her money; after waiting three days, she went to see the superintendent again. This time the man frowned, and said that he had not had time to attend to it; and when Marija, against the advice and warning of every one, tried it once more, he ordered her back to her work in a passion. Just how things happened after that Marija was not sure, but that afternoon the forelady told her that her services would not be any longer required.

She was in another canning factory, and her work was to trim the meat of those diseased cattle that Jurgis had been told about not long before. She was shut up in one of the rooms where the people seldom saw the daylight; beneath her were the chilling rooms, where the meat was frozen, and above her were the cooking rooms; and so she stood on an ice-cold floor, while her head was often so hot that she could scarcely breathe. Trimming beef off the bones by the hundred-weight, while standing up from early morning till late at night, with heavy boots on and the floor always damp and full of puddles, liable to be thrown out of work indefinitely because of a slackening in the trade, liable again to be kept overtime in rush seasons, and be worked till she trembled in every nerve and lost her grip on her slimy knife, and gave herself a poisoned wound—that was the new life that unfolded itself before Marija. But because Marija was a human horse she merely laughed and went at it; it would enable her to pay her board again, and keep the family going. And as for Tamoszius—well, they had waited a long time, and they could wait a little longer. They could not possibly get along upon his wages alone, and the family could not live without hers. He could come and visit her, and sit in the kitchen and hold her hand, and he must manage to be content with that. But day by day the music of Tamoszius’ violin became more passionate and heartbreaking; and Marija would sit with her hands clasped and her cheeks wet and all her body a-tremble, hearing in the wailing melodies the voices of the unborn generations which cried out in her for life.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000538\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000538\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000539\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000539\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Marija’s lesson came just in time to save Ona from a similar fate. Ona, too, was dissatisfied with her place, and had far more reason than Marija. She did not tell half of her story at home, because she saw it was a torment to Jurgis, and she was afraid of what he might do. For a long time Ona had seen that Miss Henderson, the forelady in her department, did not like her. At first she thought it was the old-time mistake she had made in asking for a holiday to get married. Then she concluded it must be because she did not give the forelady a present occasionally—she was the kind that took presents from the girls, Ona learned, and made all sorts of discriminations in favor of those who gave them. In the end, however, Ona discovered that it was even worse than that. Miss Henderson was a newcomer, and it was some time before rumor made her out; but finally it transpired that she was a kept woman, the former mistress of the superintendent of a department in the same building. He had put her there to keep her quiet, it seemed—and that not altogether with success, for once or twice they had been heard quarreling. She had the temper of a hyena, and soon the place she ran was a witch’s caldron. There were some of the girls who were of her own sort, who were willing to toady to her and flatter her; and these would carry tales about the rest, and so the furies were unchained in the place. Worse than this, the woman lived in a bawdy-house downtown, with a coarse, red-faced Irishman named Connor, who was the boss of the loading-gang outside, and would make free with the girls as they went to and from their work. In the slack seasons some of them would go with Miss Henderson to this house downtown—in fact, it would not be too much to say that she managed her department at Brown’s in conjunction with it. Sometimes women from the house would be given places alongside of decent girls, and after other decent girls had been turned off to make room for them. When you worked in this woman’s department the house downtown was never out of your thoughts all day—there were always whiffs of it to be caught, like the odor of the Packingtown rendering plants at night, when the wind shifted suddenly. There would be stories about it going the rounds; the girls opposite you would be telling them and winking at you. In such a place Ona would not have stayed a day, but for starvation; and, as it was, she was never sure that she could stay the next day. She understood now that the real reason that Miss Henderson hated her was that she was a decent married girl; and she knew that the talebearers and the toadies hated her for the same reason, and were doing their best to make her life miserable.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000540\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000540\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000541\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000541\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But there was no place a girl could go in Packingtown, if she was particular about things of this sort; there was no place in it where a prostitute could not get along better than a decent girl.

When he came home at night, the baby would be asleep, and it would be the merest chance if he awoke before Jurgis had to go to sleep himself. Then in the morning there was no time to look at him, so really the only chance the father had was on Sundays. This was more cruel yet for Ona, who ought to have stayed home and nursed him, the doctor said, for her own health as well as the baby’s; but Ona had to go to work, and leave him for Teta Elzbieta to feed upon the pale blue poison that was called milk at the corner grocery. Ona’s confinement lost her only a week’s wages—she would go to the factory the second Monday, and the best that Jurgis could persuade her was to ride in the car, and let him run along behind and help her to Brown’s when she alighted. After that it would be all right, said Ona, it was no strain sitting still sewing hams all day; and if she waited longer she might find that her dreadful forelady had put some one else in her place. That would be a greater calamity than ever now, Ona continued, on account of the baby. They would all have to work harder now on his account. It was such a responsibility—they must not have the baby grow up to suffer as they had.

It is difficult to convey in words all that this meant to Ona; it seemed such a slight offense, and the punishment was so out of all proportion, that neither she nor any one else ever connected the two. “Womb trouble” to Ona did not mean a specialist’s diagnosis, and a course of treatment, and perhaps an operation or two; it meant simply headaches and pains in the back, and depression and heartsickness, and neuralgia when she had to go to work in the rain. The great majority of the women who worked in Packingtown suffered in the same way, and from the same cause, so it was not deemed a thing to see the doctor about; instead Ona would try patent medicines, one after another, as her friends told her about them. As these all contained alcohol, or some other stimulant, she found that they all did her good while she took them; and so she was always chasing the phantom of good health, and losing it because she was too poor to continue.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000552\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000552\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000553\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000553\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000554\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000554\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XI</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000555\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000555\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000556\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000556\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>During the summer the packing houses were in full activity again, and Jurgis made more money.

On the contrary, the speeding-up seemed to be growing more savage all the time; they were continually inventing new devices to crowd the work on—it was for all the world like the thumbscrew of the mediæval torture chamber. They would get new pacemakers and pay them more; they would drive the men on with new machinery—it was said that in the hog-killing rooms the speed at which the hogs moved was determined by clockwork, and that it was increased a little every day. In piecework they would reduce the time, requiring the same work in a shorter time, and paying the same wages; and then, after the workers had accustomed themselves to this new speed, they would reduce the rate of payment to correspond with the reduction in time! They had done this so often in the canning establishments that the girls were fairly desperate; their wages had gone down by a full third in the past two years, and a storm of discontent was brewing that was likely to break any day. Only a month after Marija had become a beef-trimmer the canning factory that she had left posted a cut that would divide the girls’ earnings almost squarely in half; and so great was the indignation at this that they marched out without even a parley, and organized in the street outside. One of the girls had read somewhere that a red flag was the proper symbol for oppressed workers, and so they mounted one, and paraded all about the yards, yelling with rage. A new union was the result of this outburst, but the impromptu strike went to pieces in three days, owing to the rush of new labor.

It was too early yet to tell anything—the bank would not open for nearly three hours. So in a frenzy of despair Marija began to claw her way toward the doors of this building, through a throng of men, women, and children, all as excited as herself. It was a scene of wild confusion, women shrieking and wringing their hands and fainting, and men fighting and trampling down everything in their way. In the midst of the mêlée Marija recollected that she did not have her bankbook, and could not get her money anyway, so she fought her way out and started on a run for home.

So Marija was forced to take her dollars home with her, watching to right and left, expecting every instant that some one would try to rob her; and when she got home she was not much better off.

The cause of the panic had been the attempt of a policeman to arrest a drunken man in a saloon next door, which had drawn a crowd at the hour the people were on their way to work, and so started the “run.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000573\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000573\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000574\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000574\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>About this time Jurgis and Ona also began a bank account.

Also election day came round again, and Jurgis made half a week’s wages out of that, all net profit. It was a very close election that year, and the echoes of the battle reached even to Packingtown. The two rival sets of grafters hired halls and set off fireworks and made speeches, to try to get the people interested in the matter. Although Jurgis did not understand it all, he knew enough by this time to realize that it was not supposed to be right to sell your vote.

There were four days that the Ashland Avenue cars were stalled, and in those days, for the first time in his life, Jurgis knew what it was to be really opposed. He had faced difficulties before, but they had been child’s play; now there was a death struggle, and all the furies were unchained within him. The first morning they set out two hours before dawn, Ona wrapped all in blankets and tossed upon his shoulder like a sack of meal, and the little boy, bundled nearly out of sight, hanging by his coat-tails. There was a raging blast beating in his face, and the thermometer stood below zero; the snow was never short of his knees, and in some of the drifts it was nearly up to his armpits. It would catch his feet and try to trip him; it would build itself into a wall before him to beat him back; and he would fling himself into it, plunging like a wounded buffalo, puffing and snorting in rage. So foot by foot he drove his way, and when at last he came to Durham’s he was staggering and almost blind, and leaned against a pillar, gasping, and thanking God that the cattle came late to the killing beds that day. In the evening the same thing had to be done again; and because Jurgis could not tell what hour of the night he would get off, he got a saloon-keeper to let Ona sit and wait for him in a corner. Once it was eleven o’clock at night, and black as the pit, but still they got home.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000579\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000579\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000580\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000580\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>That blizzard knocked many a man out, for the crowd outside begging for work was never greater, and the packers would not wait long for any one.

There was a twinge of pain, but Jurgis was used to pain, and did not coddle himself.

Still, even then, he did nothing more than swear a little, and wrapped his foot in old rags, and hobbled out to take the car.

They sent for the company doctor, and he examined the foot and told Jurgis to go home to bed, adding that he had probably laid himself up for months by his folly.

The bitterness of it was the daily food and drink of Jurgis. It was of no use for them to try to deceive him; he knew as much about the situation as they did, and he knew that the family might literally starve to death. The worry of it fairly ate him up—he began to look haggard the first two or three days of it. In truth, it was almost maddening for a strong man like him, a fighter, to have to lie there helpless on his back. It was for all the world the old story of Prometheus bound. As Jurgis lay on his bed, hour after hour there came to him emotions that he had never known before. Before this he had met life with a welcome—it had its trials, but none that a man could not face. But now, in the nighttime, when he lay tossing about, there would come stalking into his chamber a grisly phantom, the sight of which made his flesh curl and his hair to bristle up. It was like seeing the world fall away from underneath his feet; like plunging down into a bottomless abyss into yawning caverns of despair. It might be true, then, after all, what others had told him about life, that the best powers of a man might not be equal to it! It might be true that, strive as he would, toil as he would, he might fail, and go down and be destroyed! The thought of this was like an icy hand at his heart; the thought that here, in this ghastly home of all horror, he and all those who were dear to him might lie and perish of starvation and cold, and there would be no ear to hear their cry, no hand to help them! It was true, it was true,—that here in this huge city, with its stores of heaped-up wealth, human creatures might be hunted down and destroyed by the wild-beast powers of nature, just as truly as ever they were in the days of the cave men!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000591\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000591\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000592\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000592\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Ona was now making about thirty dollars a month, and Stanislovas about thirteen. To add to this there was the board of Jonas and Marija, about forty-five dollars. Deducting from this the rent, interest, and installments on the furniture, they had left sixty dollars, and deducting the coal, they had fifty. They did without everything that human beings could do without; they went in old and ragged clothing, that left them at the mercy of the cold, and when the children’s shoes wore out, they tied them up with string. Half invalid as she was, Ona would do herself harm by walking in the rain and cold when she ought to have ridden; they bought literally nothing but food—and still they could not keep alive on fifty dollars a month. They might have done it, if only they could have gotten pure food, and at fair prices; or if only they had known what to get—if they had not been so pitifully ignorant! But they had come to a new country, where everything was different, including the food. They had always been accustomed to eat a great deal of smoked sausage, and how could they know that what they bought in America was not the same—that its color was made by chemicals, and its smoky flavor by more chemicals, and that it was full of “potato flour” besides? Potato flour is the waste of potato after the starch and alcohol have been extracted; it has no more food value than so much wood, and as its use as a food adulterant is a penal offense in Europe, thousands of tons of it are shipped to America every year.

One Saturday night he did not come home, and thereafter all their efforts to get trace of him were futile. It was said by the boss at Durham’s that he had gotten his week’s money and left there. That might not be true, of course, for sometimes they would say that when a man had been killed; it was the easiest way out of it for all concerned. When, for instance, a man had fallen into one of the rendering tanks and had been made into pure leaf lard and peerless fertilizer, there was no use letting the fact out and making his family unhappy. More probable, however, was the theory that Jonas had deserted them, and gone on the road, seeking happiness. He had been discontented for a long time, and not without some cause. He paid good board, and was yet obliged to live in a family where nobody had enough to eat. And Marija would keep giving them all her money, and of course he could not but feel that he was called upon to do the same. Then there were crying brats, and all sorts of misery; a man would have had to be a good deal of a hero to stand it all without grumbling, and Jonas was not in the least a hero—he was simply a weatherbeaten old fellow who liked to have a good supper and sit in the corner by the fire and smoke his pipe in peace before he went to bed. Here there was not room by the fire, and through the winter the kitchen had seldom been warm enough for comfort. So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea of escaping had come to him? Two years he had been yoked like a horse to a half-ton truck in Durham’s dark cellars, with never a rest, save on Sundays and four holidays in the year, and with never a word of thanks—only kicks and blows and curses, such as no decent dog would have stood. And now the winter was over, and the spring winds were blowing—and with a day’s walk a man might put the smoke of Packingtown behind him forever, and be where the grass was green and the flowers all the colors of the rainbow!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000612\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000612\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000613\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000613\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But now the income of the family was cut down more than one-third, and the food demand was cut only one-eleventh, so that they were worse off than ever.

Poor Tamoszius was a man without any relatives, and with a wonderful talent besides, and he ought to have made money and prospered; but he had fallen in love, and so given hostages to fortune, and was doomed to be dragged down too.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000614\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000614\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000615\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000615\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So it was finally decided that two more of the children would have to leave school. Next to Stanislovas, who was now fifteen, there was a girl, little Kotrina, who was two years younger, and then two boys, Vilimas, who was eleven, and Nikalojus, who was ten. Both of these last were bright boys, and there was no reason why their family should starve when tens of thousands of children no older were earning their own livings. So one morning they were given a quarter apiece and a roll with a sausage in it, and, with their minds top-heavy with good advice, were sent out to make their way to the city and learn to sell newspapers. They came back late at night in tears, having walked for the five or six miles to report that a man had offered to take them to a place where they sold newspapers, and had taken their money and gone into a store to get them, and nevermore been seen. So they both received a whipping, and the next morning set out again. This time they found the newspaper place, and procured their stock; and after wandering about till nearly noontime, saying “Paper?” to every one they saw, they had all their stock taken away and received a thrashing besides from a big newsman upon whose territory they had trespassed. Fortunately, however, they had already sold some papers, and came back with nearly as much as they started with.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000616\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000616\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000617\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000617\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After a week of mishaps such as these, the two little fellows began to learn the ways of the trade—the names of the different papers, and how many of each to get, and what sort of people to offer them to, and where to go and where to stay away from. After this, leaving home at four o’clock in the morning, and running about the streets, first with morning papers and then with evening, they might come home late at night with twenty or thirty cents apiece—possibly as much as forty cents. From this they had to deduct their carfare, since the distance was so great; but after a while they made friends, and learned still more, and then they would save their carfare. They would get on a car when the conductor was not looking, and hide in the crowd; and three times out of four he would not ask for their fares, either not seeing them, or thinking they had already paid; or if he did ask, they would hunt through their pockets, and then begin to cry, and either have their fares paid by some kind old lady, or else try the trick again on a new car. All this was fair play, they felt. Whose fault was it that at the hours when workingmen were going to their work and back, the cars were so crowded that the conductors could not collect all the fares?

A man can get used to anything in the course of time, and Jurgis had gotten used to lying about the house. Ona saw this, and was very careful not to destroy his peace of mind, by letting him know how very much pain she was suffering. It was now the time of the spring rains, and Ona had often to ride to her work, in spite of the expense; she was getting paler every day, and sometimes, in spite of her good resolutions, it pained her that Jurgis did not notice it. She wondered if he cared for her as much as ever, if all this misery was not wearing out his love. She had to be away from him all the time, and bear her own troubles while he was bearing his; and then, when she came home, she was so worn out; and whenever they talked they had only their worries to talk of—truly it was hard, in such a life, to keep any sentiment alive. The woe of this would flame up in Ona sometimes—at night she would suddenly clasp her big husband in her arms and break into passionate weeping, demanding to know if he really loved her. Poor Jurgis, who had in truth grown more matter-of-fact, under the endless pressure of penury, would not know what to make of these things, and could only try to recollect when he had last been cross; and so Ona would have to forgive him and sob herself to sleep.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000620\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000620\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000621\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000621\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The latter part of April Jurgis went to see the doctor, and was given a bandage to lace about his ankle, and told that he might go back to work.

And there were hundreds who looked and felt just like him, and who had been wandering about Packingtown for months begging for work. This was a critical time in Jurgis’ life, and if he had been a weaker man he would have gone the way the rest did.

Very few of them had the nerve to face the rebuffs that they would encounter by trying to get into the buildings to interview the bosses; if they did not get a chance in the morning, there would be nothing to do but hang about the saloons the rest of the day and night. Jurgis was saved from all this—partly, to be sure, because it was pleasant weather, and there was no need to be indoors; but mainly because he carried with him always the pitiful little face of his wife.

In the beginning he had been fresh and strong, and he had gotten a job the first day; but now he was second-hand, a damaged article, so to speak, and they did not want him. They had got the best of him—they had worn him out, with their speeding-up and their carelessness, and now they had thrown him away! And Jurgis would make the acquaintance of others of these unemployed men and find that they had all had the same experience. There were some, of course, who had wandered in from other places, who had been ground up in other mills; there were others who were out from their own fault—some, for instance, who had not been able to stand the awful grind without drink. The vast majority, however, were simply the worn-out parts of the great merciless packing machine; they had toiled there, and kept up with the pace, some of them for ten or twenty years, until finally the time had come when they could not keep up with it any more. Some had been frankly told that they were too old, that a sprier man was needed; others had given occasion, by some act of carelessness or incompetence; with most, however, the occasion had been the same as with Jurgis. They had been overworked and underfed so long, and finally some disease had laid them on their backs; or they had cut themselves, and had blood poisoning, or met with some other accident. When a man came back after that, he would get his place back only by the courtesy of the boss. To this there was no exception, save when the accident was one for which the firm was liable; in that case they would send a slippery lawyer to see him, first to try to get him to sign away his claims, but if he was too smart for that, to promise him that he and his should always be provided with work. This promise they would keep, strictly and to the letter—for two years. Two years was the “statute of limitations,” and after that the victim could not sue.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000628\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000628\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000629\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000629\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>What happened to a man after any of these things, all depended upon the circumstances.

Both Kristoforas and his brother, Juozapas, were cripples, the latter having lost one leg by having it run over, and Kristoforas having congenital dislocation of the hip, which made it impossible for him ever to walk. He was the last of Teta Elzbieta’s children, and perhaps he had been intended by nature to let her know that she had had enough. At any rate he was wretchedly sick and undersized; he had the rickets, and though he was over three years old, he was no bigger than an ordinary child of one.

Perhaps it was the smoked sausage he had eaten that morning—which may have been made out of some of the tubercular pork that was condemned as unfit for export. At any rate, an hour after eating it, the child had begun to cry with pain, and in another hour he was rolling about on the floor in convulsions. Little Kotrina, who was all alone with him, ran out screaming for help, and after a while a doctor came, but not until Kristoforas had howled his last howl. No one was really sorry about this except poor Elzbieta, who was inconsolable. Jurgis announced that so far as he was concerned the child would have to be buried by the city, since they had no money for a funeral; and at this the poor woman almost went out of her senses, wringing her hands and screaming with grief and despair. Her child to be buried in a pauper’s grave! And her stepdaughter to stand by and hear it said without protesting! It was enough to make Ona’s father rise up out of his grave to rebuke her! If it had come to this, they might as well give up at once, and be buried all of them together! . . . In the end Marija said that she would help with ten dollars; and Jurgis being still obdurate, Elzbieta went in tears and begged the money from the neighbors, and so little Kristoforas had a mass and a hearse with white plumes on it, and a tiny plot in a graveyard with a wooden cross to mark the place. The poor mother was not the same for months after that; the mere sight of the floor where little Kristoforas had crawled about would make her weep. He had never had a fair chance, poor little fellow, she would say. He had been handicapped from his birth. If only she had heard about it in time, so that she might have had that great doctor to cure him of his lameness! . . . Some time ago, Elzbieta was told, a Chicago billionaire had paid a fortune to bring a great European surgeon over to cure his little daughter of the same disease from which Kristoforas had suffered. And because this surgeon had to have bodies to demonstrate upon, he announced that he would treat the children of the poor, a piece of magnanimity over which the papers became quite eloquent. Elzbieta, alas, did not read the papers, and no one had told her; but perhaps it was as well, for just then they would not have had the carfare to spare to go every day to wait upon the surgeon, nor for that matter anybody with the time to take the child.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000637\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000637\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000638\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000638\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>All this while that he was seeking for work, there was a dark shadow hanging over Jurgis; as if a savage beast were lurking somewhere in the pathway of his life, and he knew it, and yet could not help approaching the place.

It was a summer of prosperity, all over the country, and the country ate generously of packing house products, and there was plenty of work for all the family, in spite of the packers’ efforts to keep a superfluity of labor. They were again able to pay their debts and to begin to save a little sum; but there were one or two sacrifices they considered too heavy to be made for long—it was too bad that the boys should have to sell papers at their age. It was utterly useless to caution them and plead with them; quite without knowing it, they were taking on the tone of their new environment. They were learning to swear in voluble English; they were learning to pick up cigar stumps and smoke them, to pass hours of their time gambling with pennies and dice and cigarette cards; they were learning the location of all the houses of prostitution on the “Lêvée,” and the names of the “madames” who kept them, and the days when they gave their state banquets, which the police captains and the big politicians all attended. If a visiting “country customer” were to ask them, they could show him which was “Hinkydink’s” famous saloon, and could even point out to him by name the different gamblers and thugs and “hold-up men” who made the place their headquarters. And worse yet, the boys were getting out of the habit of coming home at night. What was the use, they would ask, of wasting time and energy and a possible carfare riding out to the stockyards every night when the weather was pleasant and they could crawl under a truck or into an empty doorway and sleep exactly as well? So long as they brought home a half dollar for each day, what mattered it when they brought it? But Jurgis declared that from this to ceasing to come at all would not be a very long step, and so it was decided that Vilimas and Nikalojus should return to school in the fall, and that instead Elzbieta should go out and get some work, her place at home being taken by her younger daughter.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000661\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000661\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000662\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000662\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Little Kotrina was like most children of the poor, prematurely made old; she had to take care of her little brother, who was a cripple, and also of the baby; she had to cook the meals and wash the dishes and clean house, and have supper ready when the workers came home in the evening.

Presumably sausages were once chopped and stuffed by hand, and if so it would be interesting to know how many workers had been displaced by these inventions. On one side of the room were the hoppers, into which men shoveled loads of meat and wheelbarrows full of spices; in these great bowls were whirling knives that made two thousand revolutions a minute, and when the meat was ground fine and adulterated with potato flour, and well mixed with water, it was forced to the stuffing machines on the other side of the room. The latter were tended by women; there was a sort of spout, like the nozzle of a hose, and one of the women would take a long string of “casing” and put the end over the nozzle and then work the whole thing on, as one works on the finger of a tight glove. This string would be twenty or thirty feet long, but the woman would have it all on in a jiffy; and when she had several on, she would press a lever, and a stream of sausage meat would be shot out, taking the casing with it as it came. Thus one might stand and see appear, miraculously born from the machine, a wriggling snake of sausage of incredible length. In front was a big pan which caught these creatures, and two more women who seized them as fast as they appeared and twisted them into links. This was for the uninitiated the most perplexing work of all; for all that the woman had to give was a single turn of the wrist; and in some way she contrived to give it so that instead of an endless chain of sausages, one after another, there grew under her hands a bunch of strings, all dangling from a single center. It was quite like the feat of a prestidigitator—for the woman worked so fast that the eye could literally not follow her, and there was only a mist of motion, and tangle after tangle of sausages appearing. In the midst of the mist, however, the visitor would suddenly notice the tense set face, with the two wrinkles graven in the forehead, and the ghastly pallor of the cheeks; and then he would suddenly recollect that it was time he was going on. The woman did not go on; she stayed right there—hour after hour, day after day, year after year, twisting sausage links and racing with death. It was piecework, and she was apt to have a family to keep alive; and stern and ruthless economic laws had arranged it that she could only do this by working just as she did, with all her soul upon her work, and with never an instant for a glance at the well-dressed ladies and gentlemen who came to stare at her, as at some wild beast in a menagerie.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000667\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000667\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000668\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000668\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000669\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000669\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000670\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000670\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000671\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000671\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge of the great majority of Packingtown swindles.

In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor—a process known to the workers as “giving them thirty per cent.” Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade—there was only Number One Grade. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000674\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000674\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000675\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000675\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference. There was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white—it would be dosed with borax and glycerine, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption. There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy story and no joke; the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw one—there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit. There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they made a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage. There were the butt-ends of smoked meat, and the scraps of corned beef, and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants, that would be dumped into old barrels in the cellar and left there. Under the system of rigid economy which the packers enforced, there were some jobs that it only paid to do once in a long time, and among these was the cleaning out of the waste barrels. Every spring they did it; and in the barrels would be dirt and rust and old nails and stale water—and cartload after cartload of it would be taken up and dumped into the hoppers with fresh meat, and sent out to the public’s breakfast. Some of it they would make into “smoked” sausage—but as the smoking took time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatine to make it brown. All of their sausage came out of the same bowl, but when they came to wrap it they would stamp some of it “special,” and for this they would charge two cents more a pound.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000676\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000676\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000677\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000677\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Such were the new surroundings in which Elzbieta was placed, and such was the work she was compelled to do. It was stupefying, brutalizing work; it left her no time to think, no strength for anything. She was part of the machine she tended, and every faculty that was not needed for the machine was doomed to be crushed out of existence. There was only one mercy about the cruel grind—that it gave her the gift of insensibility. Little by little she sank into a torpor—she fell silent. She would meet Jurgis and Ona in the evening, and the three would walk home together, often without saying a word. Ona, too, was falling into a habit of silence—Ona, who had once gone about singing like a bird. She was sick and miserable, and often she would barely have strength enough to drag herself home. And there they would eat what they had to eat, and afterward, because there was only their misery to talk of, they would crawl into bed and fall into a stupor and never stir until it was time to get up again, and dress by candlelight, and go back to the machines. They were so numbed that they did not even suffer much from hunger, now; only the children continued to fret when the food ran short.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000678\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000678\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000679\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000679\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Yet the soul of Ona was not dead—the souls of none of them were dead, but only sleeping; and now and then they would waken, and these were cruel times.

In the first place she was developing a cough, like the one that had killed old Dede Antanas. She had had a trace of it ever since that fatal morning when the greedy streetcar corporation had turned her out into the rain; but now it was beginning to grow serious, and to wake her up at night. Even worse than that was the fearful nervousness from which she suffered; she would have frightful headaches and fits of aimless weeping; and sometimes she would come home at night shuddering and moaning, and would fling herself down upon the bed and burst into tears. Several times she was quite beside herself and hysterical; and then Jurgis would go half-mad with fright. Elzbieta would explain to him that it could not be helped, that a woman was subject to such things when she was pregnant; but he was hardly to be persuaded, and would beg and plead to know what had happened. She had never been like this before, he would argue—it was monstrous and unthinkable. It was the life she had to live, the accursed work she had to do, that was killing her by inches. She was not fitted for it—no woman was fitted for it, no woman ought to be allowed to do such work; if the world could not keep them alive any other way it ought to kill them at once and be done with it. They ought not to marry, to have children; no workingman ought to marry—if he, Jurgis, had known what a woman was like, he would have had his eyes torn out first. So he would carry on, becoming half hysterical himself, which was an unbearable thing to see in a big man; Ona would pull herself together and fling herself into his arms, begging him to stop, to be still, that she would be better, it would be all right. So she would lie and sob out her grief upon his shoulder, while he gazed at her, as helpless as a wounded animal, the target of unseen enemies.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000700\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000700\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000701\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000701\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000702\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000702\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XV</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000703\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000703\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000704\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000704\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The beginning of these perplexing things was in the summer; and each time Ona would promise him with terror in her voice that it would not happen again—but in vain.

It was necessary for the packing machines to grind till late at night to provide food that would be eaten at Christmas breakfasts; and Marija and Elzbieta and Ona, as part of the machine, began working fifteen or sixteen hours a day. There was no choice about this—whatever work there was to be done they had to do, if they wished to keep their places; besides that, it added another pittance to their incomes. So they staggered on with the awful load. They would start work every morning at seven, and eat their dinners at noon, and then work until ten or eleven at night without another mouthful of food. Jurgis wanted to wait for them, to help them home at night, but they would not think of this; the fertilizer mill was not running overtime, and there was no place for him to wait save in a saloon. Each would stagger out into the darkness, and make her way to the corner, where they met; or if the others had already gone, would get into a car, and begin a painful struggle to keep awake. When they got home they were always too tired either to eat or to undress; they would crawl into bed with their shoes on, and lie like logs. If they should fail, they would certainly be lost; if they held out, they might have enough coal for the winter.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000707\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000707\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000708\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000708\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>A day or two before Thanksgiving Day there came a snowstorm.

There was a breaking of floodgates, a whirl of new memories and new griefs rushing into his mind. In far Lithuania they had celebrated Christmas; and it came to him as if it had been yesterday—himself a little child, with his lost brother and his dead father in the cabin—in the deep black forest, where the snow fell all day and all night and buried them from the world. It was too far off for Santa Claus in Lithuania, but it was not too far for peace and good will to men, for the wonder-bearing vision of the Christ Child. And even in Packingtown they had not forgotten it—some gleam of it had never failed to break their darkness. Last Christmas Eve and all Christmas Day Jurgis had toiled on the killing beds, and Ona at wrapping hams, and still they had found strength enough to take the children for a walk upon the avenue, to see the store windows all decorated with Christmas trees and ablaze with electric lights. In one window there would be live geese, in another marvels in sugar—pink and white canes big enough for ogres, and cakes with cherubs upon them; in a third there would be rows of fat yellow turkeys, decorated with rosettes, and rabbits and squirrels hanging; in a fourth would be a fairyland of toys—lovely dolls with pink dresses, and woolly sheep and drums and soldier hats. Nor did they have to go without their share of all this, either. The last time they had had a big basket with them and all their Christmas marketing to do—a roast of pork and a cabbage and some rye bread, and a pair of mittens for Ona, and a rubber doll that squeaked, and a little green cornucopia full of candy to be hung from the gas jet and gazed at by half a dozen pairs of longing eyes.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000954\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000954\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000955\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000000955\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Even half a year of the sausage machines and the fertilizer mill had not been able to kill the thought of Christmas in them; there was a choking in Jurgis’ throat as he recalled that the very night Ona had not come home Teta Elzbieta had taken him aside and shown him an old valentine that she had picked up in a paper store for three cents—dingy and shopworn, but with bright colors, and figures of angels and doves.

He drew Jurgis out, and heard all about his life all but the one unmentionable thing; and then he told stories about his own life. He was a great one for stories, not always of the choicest. Being sent to jail had apparently not disturbed his cheerfulness; he had “done time” twice before, it seemed, and he took it all with a frolic welcome. What with women and wine and the excitement of his vocation, a man could afford to rest now and then.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001043\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001043\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001044\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001044\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Naturally, the aspect of prison life was changed for Jurgis by the arrival of a cell mate. He could not turn his face to the wall and sulk, he had to speak when he was spoken to; nor could he help being interested in the conversation of Duane—the first educated man with whom he had ever talked. How could he help listening with wonder while the other told of midnight ventures and perilous escapes, of feastings and orgies, of fortunes squandered in a night? The young fellow had an amused contempt for Jurgis, as a sort of working mule; he, too, had felt the world’s injustice, but instead of bearing it patiently, he had struck back, and struck hard. He was striking all the time—there was war between him and society. He was a genial freebooter, living off the enemy, without fear or shame. He was not always victorious, but then defeat did not mean annihilation, and need not break his spirit.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001045\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001045\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001046\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001046\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Withal he was a goodhearted fellow—too much so, it appeared. His story came out, not in the first day, nor the second, but in the long hours that dragged by, in which they had nothing to do but talk and nothing to talk of but themselves. Jack Duane was from the East; he was a college-bred man—had been studying electrical engineering. Then his father had met with misfortune in business and killed himself; and there had been his mother and a younger brother and sister. Also, there was an invention of Duane’s; Jurgis could not understand it clearly, but it had to do with telegraphing, and it was a very important thing—there were fortunes in it, millions upon millions of dollars. And Duane had been robbed of it by a great company, and got tangled up in lawsuits and lost all his money. Then somebody had given him a tip on a horse race, and he had tried to retrieve his fortune with another person’s money, and had to run away, and all the rest had come from that. The other asked him what had led him to safe-breaking—to Jurgis a wild and appalling occupation to think about. A man he had met, his cell mate had replied—one thing leads to another. Didn’t he ever wonder about his family, Jurgis asked. Sometimes, the other answered, but not often—he didn’t allow it. Thinking about it would make it no better. This wasn’t a world in which a man had any business with a family; sooner or later Jurgis would find that out also, and give up the fight and shift for himself.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001047\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001047\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001048\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001048\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Jurgis was so transparently what he pretended to be that his cell mate was as open with him as a child; it was pleasant to tell him adventures, he was so full of wonder and admiration, he was so new to the ways of the country.

There were hardened criminals and innocent men too poor to give bail; old men, and boys literally not yet in their teens. They were the drainage of the great festering ulcer of society; they were hideous to look upon, sickening to talk to. All life had turned to rottenness and stench in them—love was a beastliness, joy was a snare, and God was an imprecation. They strolled here and there about the courtyard, and Jurgis listened to them. He was ignorant and they were wise; they had been everywhere and tried everything. They could tell the whole hateful story of it, set forth the inner soul of a city in which justice and honor, women’s bodies and men’s souls, were for sale in the marketplace, and human beings writhed and fought and fell upon each other like wolves in a pit; in which lusts were raging fires, and men were fuel, and humanity was festering and stewing and wallowing in its own corruption. Into this wild-beast tangle these men had been born without their consent, they had taken part in it because they could not help it; that they were in jail was no disgrace to them, for the game had never been fair, the dice were loaded.

An icy horror of loneliness seized him; he saw himself standing apart and watching all the world fade away from him—a world of shadows, of fickle dreams.

He had never dreamed how much he loved Ona, until now that she was gone; until now that he sat here, knowing that on the morrow they would take her away, and that he would never lay eyes upon her again—never all the days of his life. His old love, which had been starved to death, beaten to death, awoke in him again; the floodgates of memory were lifted—he saw all their life together, saw her as he had seen her in Lithuania, the first day at the fair, beautiful as the flowers, singing like a bird. He saw her as he had married her, with all her tenderness, with her heart of wonder; the very words she had spoken seemed to ring now in his ears, the tears she had shed to be wet upon his cheek. The long, cruel battle with misery and hunger had hardened and embittered him, but it had not changed her—she had been the same hungry soul to the end, stretching out her arms to him, pleading with him, begging him for love and tenderness. And she had suffered—so cruelly she had suffered, such agonies, such infamies—ah, God, the memory of them was not to be borne. What a monster of wickedness, of heartlessness, he had been! Every angry word that he had ever spoken came back to him and cut him like a knife; every selfish act that he had done—with what torments he paid for them now! And such devotion and awe as welled up in his soul—now that it could never be spoken, now that it was too late, too late! His bosom-was choking with it, bursting with it; he crouched here in the darkness beside her, stretching out his arms to her—and she was gone forever, she was dead! He could have screamed aloud with the horror and despair of it; a sweat of agony beaded his forehead, yet he dared not make a sound—he scarcely dared to breathe, because of his shame and loathing of himself.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001560\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001560\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001561\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001561\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Late at night came Elzbieta, having gotten the money for a mass, and paid for it in advance, lest she should be tempted too sorely at home.

Ona was dead, but the others were left and they must be saved. She did not ask for her own children. She and Marija could care for them somehow, but there was Antanas, his own son. Ona had given Antanas to him—the little fellow was the only remembrance of her that he had; he must treasure it and protect it, he must show himself a man. He knew what Ona would have had him do, what she would ask of him at this moment, if she could speak to him. It was a terrible thing that she should have died as she had; but the life had been too hard for her, and she had to go. It was terrible that they were not able to bury her, that he could not even have a day to mourn her—but so it was. Their fate was pressing; they had not a cent, and the children would perish—some money must be had. Could he not be a man for Ona’s sake, and pull himself together? In a little while they would be out of danger—now that they had given up the house they could live more cheaply, and with all the children working they could get along, if only he would not go to pieces. So Elzbieta went on, with feverish intensity.

He would never be told anything about it; he would never get any more satisfaction than he had gotten just now; but he would always find when the time came that he was not needed.

Jurgis saw very little of it, of course—it was all specialized work, the same as at the stockyards; each one of the hundreds of parts of a mowing machine was made separately, and sometimes handled by hundreds of men. Where Jurgis worked there was a machine which cut and stamped a certain piece of steel about two square inches in size; the pieces came tumbling out upon a tray, and all that human hands had to do was to pile them in regular rows, and change the trays at intervals. This was done by a single boy, who stood with eyes and thought centered upon it, and fingers flying so fast that the sounds of the bits of steel striking upon each other was like the music of an express train as one hears it in a sleeping car at night. This was “piece-work,” of course; and besides it was made certain that the boy did not idle, by setting the machine to match the highest possible speed of human hands. Thirty thousand of these pieces he handled every day, nine or ten million every year—how many in a lifetime it rested with the gods to say. Near by him men sat bending over whirling grindstones, putting the finishing touches to the steel knives of the reaper; picking them out of a basket with the right hand, pressing first one side and then the other against the stone and finally dropping them with the left hand into another basket. One of these men told Jurgis that he had sharpened three thousand pieces of steel a day for thirteen years. In the next room were wonderful machines that ate up long steel rods by slow stages, cutting them off, seizing the pieces, stamping heads upon them, grinding them and polishing them, threading them, and finally dropping them into a basket, all ready to bolt the harvesters together. From yet another machine came tens of thousands of steel burs to fit upon these bolts. In other places all these various parts were dipped into troughs of paint and hung up to dry, and then slid along on trolleys to a room where men streaked them with red and yellow, so that they might look cheerful in the harvest fields.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001632\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001632\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001633\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001633\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Jurgis’s friend worked upstairs in the casting rooms, and his task was to make the molds of a certain part.

You might see him, along with dozens of others, toiling like one possessed by a whole community of demons; his arms working like the driving rods of an engine, his long, black hair flying wild, his eyes starting out, the sweat rolling in rivers down his face.

Jurgis began to pick up heart again and to make plans. He had lost his house but then the awful load of the rent and interest was off his shoulders, and when Marija was well again they could start over and save. In the shop where he worked was a man, a Lithuanian like himself, whom the others spoke of in admiring whispers, because of the mighty feats he was performing. All day he sat at a machine turning bolts; and then in the evening he went to the public school to study English and learn to read. In addition, because he had a family of eight children to support and his earnings were not enough, on Saturdays and Sundays he served as a watchman; he was required to press two buttons at opposite ends of a building every five minutes, and as the walk only took him two minutes, he had three minutes to study between each trip. Jurgis felt jealous of this fellow; for that was the sort of thing he himself had dreamed of, two or three years ago. He might do it even yet, if he had a fair chance—he might attract attention and become a skilled man or a boss, as some had done in this place.

Little Juozapas, who was near crazy with hunger these days, had gone out on the street to beg for himself. Juozapas had only one leg, having been run over by a wagon when a little child, but he had got himself a broomstick, which he put under his arm for a crutch. He had fallen in with some other children and found the way to Mike Scully’s dump, which lay three or four blocks away. To this place there came every day many hundreds of wagon-loads of garbage and trash from the lake front, where the rich people lived; and in the heaps the children raked for food—there were hunks of bread and potato peelings and apple cores and meat bones, all of it half frozen and quite unspoiled. Little Juozapas gorged himself, and came home with a newspaper full, which he was feeding to Antanas when his mother came in. Elzbieta was horrified, for she did not believe that the food out of the dumps was fit to eat. The next day, however, when no harm came of it and Juozapas began to cry with hunger, she gave in and said that he might go again. And that afternoon he came home with a story of how while he had been digging away with a stick, a lady upon the street had called him. A real fine lady, the little boy explained, a beautiful lady; and she wanted to know all about him, and whether he got the garbage for chickens, and why he walked with a broomstick, and why Ona had died, and how Jurgis had come to go to jail, and what was the matter with Marija, and everything. In the end she had asked where he lived, and said that she was coming to see him, and bring him a new crutch to walk with. She had on a hat with a bird upon it, Juozapas added, and a long fur snake around her neck.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001661\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001661\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001662\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001662\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>She really came, the very next morning, and climbed the ladder to the garret, and stood and stared about her, turning pale at the sight of the blood stains on the floor where Ona had died.

Jurgis stood where the balcony of the theater would have been, and opposite, by the stage, he saw three giant caldrons, big enough for all the devils of hell to brew their broth in, full of something white and blinding, bubbling and splashing, roaring as if volcanoes were blowing through it—one had to shout to be heard in the place. Liquid fire would leap from these caldrons and scatter like bombs below—and men were working there, seeming careless, so that Jurgis caught his breath with fright. Then a whistle would toot, and across the curtain of the theater would come a little engine with a carload of something to be dumped into one of the receptacles; and then another whistle would toot, down by the stage, and another train would back up—and suddenly, without an instant’s warning, one of the giant kettles began to tilt and topple, flinging out a jet of hissing, roaring flame. Jurgis shrank back appalled, for he thought it was an accident; there fell a pillar of white flame, dazzling as the sun, swishing like a huge tree falling in the forest. A torrent of sparks swept all the way across the building, overwhelming everything, hiding it from sight; and then Jurgis looked through the fingers of his hands, and saw pouring out of the caldron a cascade of living, leaping fire, white with a whiteness not of earth, scorching the eyeballs. Incandescent rainbows shone above it, blue, red, and golden lights played about it; but the stream itself was white, ineffable. Out of regions of wonder it streamed, the very river of life; and the soul leaped up at the sight of it, fled back upon it, swift and resistless, back into far-off lands, where beauty and terror dwell. Then the great caldron tilted back again, empty, and Jurgis saw to his relief that no one was hurt, and turned and followed his guide out into the sunlight.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001675\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001675\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001676\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001676\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>They went through the blast furnaces, through rolling mills where bars of steel were tossed about and chopped like bits of cheese.

He learned to find his way about and to take all the miracles and terrors for granted, to work without hearing the rumbling and crashing. From blind fear he went to the other extreme; he became reckless and indifferent, like all the rest of the men, who took but little thought of themselves in the ardor of their work. It was wonderful, when one came to think of it, that these men should have taken an interest in the work they did—they had no share in it—they were paid by the hour, and paid no more for being interested. Also they knew that if they were hurt they would be flung aside and forgotten—and still they would hurry to their task by dangerous short cuts, would use methods that were quicker and more effective in spite of the fact that they were also risky. His fourth day at his work Jurgis saw a man stumble while running in front of a car, and have his foot mashed off, and before he had been there three weeks he was witness of a yet more dreadful accident. There was a row of brick furnaces, shining white through every crack with the molten steel inside. Some of these were bulging dangerously, yet men worked before them, wearing blue glasses when they opened and shut the doors. One morning as Jurgis was passing, a furnace blew out, spraying two men with a shower of liquid fire. As they lay screaming and rolling upon the ground in agony, Jurgis rushed to help them, and as a result he lost a good part of the skin from the inside of one of his hands. The company doctor bandaged it up, but he got no other thanks from any one, and was laid up for eight working days without any pay.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001685\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001685\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001686\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001686\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Most fortunately, at this juncture, Elzbieta got the long-awaited chance to go at five o’clock in the morning and help scrub the office floors of one of the packers.

He learned so fast that every week when Jurgis came home it seemed to him as if he had a new child. He would sit down and listen and stare at him, and give vent to delighted exclamations—“<i>Palauk! Muma! Tu mano szirdele!</i>” The little fellow was now really the one delight that Jurgis had in the world—his one hope, his one victory. Thank God, Antanas was a boy! And he was as tough as a pine knot, and with the appetite of a wolf. Nothing had hurt him, and nothing could hurt him; he had come through all the suffering and deprivation unscathed—only shriller-voiced and more determined in his grip upon life. He was a terrible child to manage, was Antanas, but his father did not mind that—he would watch him and smile to himself with satisfaction. The more of a fighter he was the better—he would need to fight before he got through.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001689\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001689\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001690\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001690\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Jurgis had got the habit of buying the Sunday paper whenever he had the money; a most wonderful paper could be had for only five cents, a whole armful, with all the news of the world set forth in big headlines, that Jurgis could spell out slowly, with the children to help him at the long words. There was battle and murder and sudden death—it was marvelous how they ever heard about so many entertaining and thrilling happenings; the stories must be all true, for surely no man could have made such things up, and besides, there were pictures of them all, as real as life. One of these papers was as good as a circus, and nearly as good as a spree—certainly a most wonderful treat for a workingman, who was tired out and stupefied, and had never had any education, and whose work was one dull, sordid grind, day after day, and year after year, with never a sight of a green field nor an hour’s entertainment, nor anything but liquor to stimulate his imagination. Among other things, these papers had pages full of comical pictures, and these were the main joy in life to little Antanas. He treasured them up, and would drag them out and make his father tell him about them; there were all sorts of animals among them, and Antanas could tell the names of all of them, lying upon the floor for hours and pointing them out with his chubby little fingers. Whenever the story was plain enough for Jurgis to make out, Antanas would have it repeated to him, and then he would remember it, prattling funny little sentences and mixing it up with other stories in an irresistible fashion. Also his quaint pronunciation of words was such a delight—and the phrases he would pick up and remember, the most outlandish and impossible things! The first time that the little rascal burst out with “God damn,” his father nearly rolled off the chair with glee; but in the end he was sorry for this, for Antanas was soon “God-damning” everything and everybody.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001691\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001691\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001692\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001692\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then, when he was able to use his hands, Jurgis took his bedding again and went back to his task of shifting rails.

Jurgis would have to wade through it to get home, and if it was late he might easily get stuck to his waist in the mire. But he did not mind this much—it was a promise that summer was coming. Marija had now gotten a place as beef-trimmer in one of the smaller packing plants; and he told himself that he had learned his lesson now, and would meet with no more accidents—so that at last there was prospect of an end to their long agony. They could save money again, and when another winter came they would have a comfortable place; and the children would be off the streets and in school again, and they might set to work to nurse back into life their habits of decency and kindness.

Of these there was an army, the huge surplus labor army of society; called into being under the stern system of nature, to do the casual work of the world, the tasks which were transient and irregular, and yet which had to be done. They did not know that they were such, of course; they only knew that they sought the job, and that the job was fleeting. In the early summer they would be in Texas, and as the crops were ready they would follow north with the season, ending with the fall in Manitoba. Then they would seek out the big lumber camps, where there was winter work; or failing in this, would drift to the cities, and live upon what they had managed to save, with the help of such transient work as was there the loading and unloading of steamships and drays, the digging of ditches and the shoveling of snow. If there were more of them on hand than chanced to be needed, the weaker ones died off of cold and hunger, again according to the stern system of nature.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001810\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001810\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001811\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001811\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was in the latter part of July, when Jurgis was in Missouri, that he came upon the harvest work.

Jurgis joined a gang and worked from dawn till dark, eighteen hours a day, for two weeks without a break. Then he had a sum of money that would have been a fortune to him in the old days of misery—but what could he do with it now? To be sure he might have put it in a bank, and, if he were fortunate, get it back again when he wanted it. But Jurgis was now a homeless man, wandering over a continent; and what did he know about banking and drafts and letters of credit? If he carried the money about with him, he would surely be robbed in the end; and so what was there for him to do but enjoy it while he could? On a Saturday night he drifted into a town with his fellows; and because it was raining, and there was no other place provided for him, he went to a saloon. And there were some who treated him and whom he had to treat, and there was laughter and singing and good cheer; and then out of the rear part of the saloon a girl’s face, red-cheeked and merry, smiled at Jurgis, and his heart thumped suddenly in his throat. He nodded to her, and she came and sat by him, and they had more drink, and then he went upstairs into a room with her, and the wild beast rose up within him and screamed, as it has screamed in the Jungle from the dawn of time. And then because of his memories and his shame, he was glad when others joined them, men and women; and they had more drink and spent the night in wild rioting and debauchery. In the van of the surplus-labor army, there followed another, an army of women, they also struggling for life under the stern system of nature. Because there were rich men who sought pleasure, there had been ease and plenty for them so long as they were young and beautiful; and later on, when they were crowded out by others younger and more beautiful, they went out to follow upon the trail of the workingmen. Sometimes they came of themselves, and the saloon-keepers shared with them; or sometimes they were handled by agencies, the same as the labor army. They were in the towns in harvest time, near the lumber camps in the winter, in the cities when the men came there; if a regiment were encamped, or a railroad or canal being made, or a great exposition getting ready, the crowd of women were on hand, living in shanties or saloons or tenement rooms, sometimes eight or ten of them together.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001814\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001814\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001815\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001815\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the morning Jurgis had not a cent, and he went out upon the road again.

The rest had crawled into the closet where they slept, but the baby was to have a bath, the workingman explained. The nights had begun to be chilly, and his mother, ignorant as to the climate in America, had sewed him up for the winter; then it had turned warm again, and some kind of a rash had broken out on the child.

It was nearly a year afterward that he finally learned the meaning of this whole affair. The City Council had passed a quiet and innocent little bill allowing a company to construct telephone conduits under the city streets; and upon the strength of this, a great corporation had proceeded to tunnel all Chicago with a system of railway freight-subways. In the city there was a combination of employers, representing hundreds of millions of capital, and formed for the purpose of crushing the labor unions. The chief union which troubled it was the teamsters’; and when these freight tunnels were completed, connecting all the big factories and stores with the railroad depots, they would have the teamsters’ union by the throat. Now and then there were rumors and murmurs in the Board of Aldermen, and once there was a committee to investigate—but each time another small fortune was paid over, and the rumors died away; until at last the city woke up with a start to find the work completed. There was a tremendous scandal, of course; it was found that the city records had been falsified and other crimes committed, and some of Chicago’s big capitalists got into jail—figuratively speaking. The aldermen declared that they had had no idea of it all, in spite of the fact that the main entrance to the work had been in the rear of the saloon of one of them.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001861\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001861\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001862\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001862\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was in a newly opened cut that Jurgis worked, and so he knew that he had an all-winter job. He was so rejoiced that he treated himself to a spree that night, and with the balance of his money he hired himself a place in a tenement room, where he slept upon a big homemade straw mattress along with four other workingmen. This was one dollar a week, and for four more he got his food in a boardinghouse near his work. This would leave him four dollars extra each week, an unthinkable sum for him. At the outset he had to pay for his digging tools, and also to buy a pair of heavy boots, since his shoes were falling to pieces, and a flannel shirt, since the one he had worn all summer was in shreds. He spent a week meditating whether or not he should also buy an overcoat. There was one belonging to a Hebrew collar button peddler, who had died in the room next to him, and which the landlady was holding for her rent; in the end, however, Jurgis decided to do without it, as he was to be underground by day and in bed at night.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001863\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001863\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001864\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001864\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This was an unfortunate decision, however, for it drove him more quickly than ever into the saloons. From now on Jurgis worked from seven o’clock until half-past five, with half an hour for dinner; which meant that he never saw the sunlight on weekdays. In the evenings there was no place for him to go except a barroom; no place where there was light and warmth, where he could hear a little music or sit with a companion and talk. He had now no home to go to; he had no affection left in his life—only the pitiful mockery of it in the <i>camaraderie</i> of vice. On Sundays the churches were open—but where was there a church in which an ill-smelling workingman, with vermin crawling upon his neck, could sit without seeing people edge away and look annoyed? He had, of course, his corner in a close though unheated room, with a window opening upon a blank wall two feet away; and also he had the bare streets, with the winter gales sweeping through them; besides this he had only the saloons—and, of course, he had to drink to stay in them. If he drank now and then he was free to make himself at home, to gamble with dice or a pack of greasy cards, to play at a dingy pool table for money, or to look at a beer-stained pink “sporting paper,” with pictures of murderers and half-naked women. It was for such pleasures as these that he spent his money; and such was his life during the six weeks and a half that he toiled for the merchants of Chicago, to enable them to break the grip of their teamsters’ union.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001865\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001865\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001866\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001866\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In a work thus carried out, not much thought was given to the welfare of the laborers.

He was so hungry this time that he could not resist the hot beef stew, an indulgence which cut short his stay by a considerable time. When he was again told to move on, he made his way to a “tough” place in the “Lêvée” district, where now and then he had gone with a certain rat-eyed Bohemian workingman of his acquaintance, seeking a woman. It was Jurgis’s vain hope that here the proprietor would let him remain as a “sitter.” In low-class places, in the dead of winter, saloon-keepers would often allow one or two forlorn-looking bums who came in covered with snow or soaked with rain to sit by the fire and look miserable to attract custom. A workingman would come in, feeling cheerful after his day’s work was over, and it would trouble him to have to take his glass with such a sight under his nose; and so he would call out: “Hello, Bub, what’s the matter? You look as if you’d been up against it!” And then the other would begin to pour out some tale of misery, and the man would say, “Come have a glass, and maybe that’ll brace you up.” And so they would drink together, and if the tramp was sufficiently wretched-looking, or good enough at the “gab,” they might have two; and if they were to discover that they were from the same country, or had lived in the same city or worked at the same trade, they might sit down at a table and spend an hour or two in talk—and before they got through the saloon-keeper would have taken in a dollar. All of this might seem diabolical, but the saloon-keeper was in no wise to blame for it. He was in the same plight as the manufacturer who has to adulterate and misrepresent his product. If he does not, some one else will; and the saloon-keeper, unless he is also an alderman, is apt to be in debt to the big brewers, and on the verge of being sold out.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001881\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001881\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001882\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001882\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The market for “sitters” was glutted that afternoon, however, and there was no place for Jurgis.

So all the hiding places of the city were crowded, and before that station house door men fought and tore each other like savage beasts. When at last the place was jammed and they shut the doors, half the crowd was still outside; and Jurgis, with his helpless arm, was among them. There was no choice then but to go to a lodging-house and spend another dime.

Also he could find a comfortable seat by a fire, and could chat with a companion until he was as warm as toast. At the saloon, too, he felt at home.

He was just out of the hospital, and desperately sick-looking, and with a helpless arm; also he had no overcoat, and shivered pitifully. But, alas, it was again the case of the honest merchant, who finds that the genuine and unadulterated article is driven to the wall by the artistic counterfeit. Jurgis, as a beggar, was simply a blundering amateur in competition with organized and scientific professionalism. He was just out of the hospital—but the story was worn threadbare, and how could he prove it? He had his arm in a sling—and it was a device a regular beggar’s little boy would have scorned. He was pale and shivering—but they were made up with cosmetics, and had studied the art of chattering their teeth. As to his being without an overcoat, among them you would meet men you could swear had on nothing but a ragged linen duster and a pair of cotton trousers—so cleverly had they concealed the several suits of all-wool underwear beneath. Many of these professional mendicants had comfortable homes, and families, and thousands of dollars in the bank; some of them had retired upon their earnings, and gone into the business of fitting out and doctoring others, or working children at the trade. There were some who had both their arms bound tightly to their sides, and padded stumps in their sleeves, and a sick child hired to carry a cup for them. There were some who had no legs, and pushed themselves upon a wheeled platform—some who had been favored with blindness, and were led by pretty little dogs. Some less fortunate had mutilated themselves or burned themselves, or had brought horrible sores upon themselves with chemicals; you might suddenly encounter upon the street a man holding out to you a finger rotting and discolored with gangrene—or one with livid scarlet wounds half escaped from their filthy bandages. These desperate ones were the dregs of the city’s cesspools, wretches who hid at night in the rain-soaked cellars of old ramshackle tenements, in “stale-beer dives” and opium joints, with abandoned women in the last stages of the harlot’s progress—women who had been kept by Chinamen and turned away at last to die. Every day the police net would drag hundreds of them off the streets, and in the detention hospital you might see them, herded together in a miniature inferno, with hideous, beastly faces, bloated and leprous with disease, laughing, shouting, screaming in all stages of drunkenness, barking like dogs, gibbering like apes, raving and tearing themselves in delirium.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001897\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001897\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001898\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001898\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001899\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001899\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001900\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001900\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001901\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001901\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the face of all his handicaps, Jurgis was obliged to make the price of a lodging, and of a drink every hour or two, under penalty of freezing to death.

He saw the world of civilization then more plainly than ever he had seen it before; a world in which nothing counted but brutal might, an order devised by those who possessed it for the subjugation of those who did not. He was one of the latter; and all outdoors, all life, was to him one colossal prison, which he paced like a pent-up tiger, trying one bar after another, and finding them all beyond his power. He had lost in the fierce battle of greed, and so was doomed to be exterminated; and all society was busied to see that he did not escape the sentence. Everywhere that he turned were prison bars, and hostile eyes following him; the well-fed, sleek policemen, from whose glances he shrank, and who seemed to grip their clubs more tightly when they saw him; the saloon-keepers, who never ceased to watch him while he was in their places, who were jealous of every moment he lingered after he had paid his money; the hurrying throngs upon the streets, who were deaf to his entreaties, oblivious of his very existence—and savage and contemptuous when he forced himself upon them. They had their own affairs, and there was no place for him among them. There was no place for him anywhere—every direction he turned his gaze, this fact was forced upon him: Everything was built to express it to him: the residences, with their heavy walls and bolted doors, and basement windows barred with iron; the great warehouses filled with the products of the whole world, and guarded by iron shutters and heavy gates; the banks with their unthinkable billions of wealth, all buried in safes and vaults of steel.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001902\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001902\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001903\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001903\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then one day there befell Jurgis the one adventure of his life.

Then his eye passed to the long table in the center of the hall, a table black as ebony, and gleaming with wrought silver and gold. In the center of it was a huge carven bowl, with the glistening gleam of ferns and the red and purple of rare orchids, glowing from a light hidden somewhere in their midst.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001998\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001998\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001999\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000001999\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“This’s the dinin’ room,” observed Master Freddie. “How you like it, hey, ole sport?”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002000\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002000\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002001\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002001\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>He always insisted on having an answer to his remarks, leaning over Jurgis and smiling into his face.

This time he talked for ten minutes at a stretch, and in the course of the speech he told Jurgis all of his family history. His big brother Charlie was in love with the guileless maiden who played the part of “Little Bright-Eyes” in “The Kaliph of Kamskatka.” He had been on the verge of marrying her once, only “the guv’ner” had sworn to disinherit him, and had presented him with a sum that would stagger the imagination, and that had staggered the virtue of “Little Bright-Eyes.” Now Charlie had got leave from college, and had gone away in his automobile on the next best thing to a honeymoon. “The guv’ner” had made threats to disinherit another of his children also, sister Gwendolen, who had married an Italian marquis with a string of titles and a dueling record. They lived in his chateau, or rather had, until he had taken to firing the breakfast dishes at her; then she had cabled for help, and the old gentleman had gone over to find out what were his Grace’s terms. So they had left Freddie all alone, and he with less than two thousand dollars in his pocket. Freddie was up in arms and meant serious business, as they would find in the end—if there was no other way of bringing them to terms he would have his “Kittens” wire that she was about to marry him, and see what happened then.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002082\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002082\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002083\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002083\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So the cheerful youngster rattled on, until he was tired out.

Then after a long interval came the heavy tread of a policeman, and they held their breath till he was gone. Though half-frozen, they waited a full quarter of an hour after that—and then again came footsteps, walking briskly. Duane nudged Jurgis, and the instant the man had passed they rose up. Duane stole out as silently as a shadow, and a second later Jurgis heard a thud and a stifled cry. He was only a couple of feet behind, and he leaped to stop the man’s mouth, while Duane held him fast by the arms, as they had agreed. But the man was limp and showed a tendency to fall, and so Jurgis had only to hold him by the collar, while the other, with swift fingers, went through his pockets—ripping open, first his overcoat, and then his coat, and then his vest, searching inside and outside, and transferring the contents into his own pockets. At last, after feeling of the man’s fingers and in his necktie, Duane whispered, “That’s all!” and they dragged him to the area and dropped him in.

The city, which was owned by an oligarchy of business men, being nominally ruled by the people, a huge army of graft was necessary for the purpose of effecting the transfer of power. Twice a year, in the spring and fall elections, millions of dollars were furnished by the business men and expended by this army; meetings were held and clever speakers were hired, bands played and rockets sizzled, tons of documents and reservoirs of drinks were distributed, and tens of thousands of votes were bought for cash. And this army of graft had, of course, to be maintained the year round. The leaders and organizers were maintained by the business men directly—aldermen and legislators by means of bribes, party officials out of the campaign funds, lobbyists and corporation lawyers in the form of salaries, contractors by means of jobs, labor union leaders by subsidies, and newspaper proprietors and editors by advertisements. The rank and file, however, were either foisted upon the city, or else lived off the population directly. There was the police department, and the fire and water departments, and the whole balance of the civil list, from the meanest office boy to the head of a city department; and for the horde who could find no room in these, there was the world of vice and crime, there was license to seduce, to swindle and plunder and prey. The law forbade Sunday drinking; and this had delivered the saloon-keepers into the hands of the police, and made an alliance between them necessary. The law forbade prostitution; and this had brought the “madames” into the combination. It was the same with the gambling-house keeper and the poolroom man, and the same with any other man or woman who had a means of getting “graft,” and was willing to pay over a share of it: the green-goods man and the highwayman, the pickpocket and the sneak thief, and the receiver of stolen goods, the seller of adulterated milk, of stale fruit and diseased meat, the proprietor of unsanitary tenements, the fake doctor and the usurer, the beggar and the “pushcart man,” the prize fighter and the professional slugger, the race-track “tout,” the procurer, the white-slave agent, and the expert seducer of young girls. All of these agencies of corruption were banded together, and leagued in blood brotherhood with the politician and the police; more often than not they were one and the same person,—the police captain would own the brothel he pretended to raid, the politician would open his headquarters in his saloon. “Hinkydink” or “Bathhouse John,” or others of that ilk, were proprietors of the most notorious dives in Chicago, and also the “gray wolves” of the city council, who gave away the streets of the city to the business men; and those who patronized their places were the gamblers and prize fighters who set the law at defiance, and the burglars and holdup men who kept the whole city in terror. On election day all these powers of vice and crime were one power; they could tell within one per cent what the vote of their district would be, and they could change it at an hour’s notice.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002271\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002271\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002272\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002272\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>A month ago Jurgis had all but perished of starvation upon the streets; and now suddenly, as by the gift of a magic key, he had entered into a world where money and all the good things of life came freely.

This man talked with Jurgis for a while, and then told him that he had a little plan by which a man who looked like a workingman might make some easy money; but it was a private affair, and had to be kept quiet. Jurgis expressed himself as agreeable, and the other took him that afternoon (it was Saturday) to a place where city laborers were being paid off. The paymaster sat in a little booth, with a pile of envelopes before him, and two policemen standing by. Jurgis went, according to directions, and gave the name of “Michael O’Flaherty,” and received an envelope, which he took around the corner and delivered to Halloran, who was waiting for him in a saloon. Then he went again; and gave the name of “Johann Schmidt,” and a third time, and give the name of “Serge Reminitsky.” Halloran had quite a list of imaginary workingmen, and Jurgis got an envelope for each one.

As Jurgis was excellent at keeping quiet, he soon won the trust of “Buck” Halloran, and was introduced to others as a man who could be depended upon.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002273\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002273\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002274\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002274\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This acquaintance was useful to him in another way, also before long Jurgis made his discovery of the meaning of “pull,” and just why his boss, Connor, and also the pugilist bartender, had been able to send him to jail. One night there was given a ball, the “benefit” of “One-eyed Larry,” a lame man who played the violin in one of the big “high-class” houses of prostitution on Clark Street, and was a wag and a popular character on the “Lêvée.” This ball was held in a big dance hall, and was one of the occasions when the city’s powers of debauchery gave themselves up to madness. Jurgis attended and got half insane with drink, and began quarreling over a girl; his arm was pretty strong by then, and he set to work to clean out the place, and ended in a cell in the police station. The police station being crowded to the doors, and stinking with “bums,” Jurgis did not relish staying there to sleep off his liquor, and sent for Halloran, who called up the district leader and had Jurgis bailed out by telephone at four o’clock in the morning. When he was arraigned that same morning, the district leader had already seen the clerk of the court and explained that Jurgis Rudkus was a decent fellow, who had been indiscreet; and so Jurgis was fined ten dollars and the fine was “suspended”—which meant that he did not have to pay for it, and never would have to pay it, unless somebody chose to bring it up against him in the future.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002275\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002275\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002276\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002276\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Among the people Jurgis lived with now money was valued according to an entirely different standard from that of the people of Packingtown; yet, strange as it may seem, he did a great deal less drinking than he had as a workingman.

In the saloon where Jurgis met “Buck” Halloran he was sitting late one night with Duane, when a “country customer” (a buyer for an out-of-town merchant) came in, a little more than half “piped.” There was no one else in the place but the bartender, and as the man went out again Jurgis and Duane followed him; he went round the corner, and in a dark place made by a combination of the elevated railroad and an unrented building, Jurgis leaped forward and shoved a revolver under his nose, while Duane, with his hat pulled over his eyes, went through the man’s pockets with lightning fingers. They got his watch and his “wad,” and were round the corner again and into the saloon before he could shout more than once. The bartender, to whom they had tipped the wink, had the cellar door open for them, and they vanished, making their way by a secret entrance to a brothel next door. From the roof of this there was access to three similar places beyond. By means of these passages the customers of any one place could be gotten out of the way, in case a falling out with the police chanced to lead to a raid; and also it was necessary to have a way of getting a girl out of reach in case of an emergency. Thousands of them came to Chicago answering advertisements for “servants” and “factory hands,” and found themselves trapped by fake employment agencies, and locked up in a bawdy-house. It was generally enough to take all their clothes away from them; but sometimes they would have to be “doped” and kept prisoners for weeks; and meantime their parents might be telegraphing the police, and even coming on to see why nothing was done. Occasionally there was no way of satisfying them but to let them search the place to which the girl had been traced.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002279\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002279\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002280\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002280\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>For his help in this little job, the bartender received twenty out of the hundred and thirty odd dollars that the pair secured; and naturally this put them on friendly terms with him, and a few days later he introduced them to a little “sheeny” named Goldberger, one of the “runners” of the “sporting house” where they had been hidden.

It owned the legislatures in every state in which it did business; it even owned some of the big newspapers, and made public opinion—there was no power in the land that could oppose it unless, perhaps, it were the Poolroom Trust. It built magnificent racing parks all over the country, and by means of enormous purses it lured the people to come, and then it organized a gigantic shell game, whereby it plundered them of hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Horse racing had once been a sport, but nowadays it was a business; a horse could be “doped” and doctored, undertrained or overtrained; it could be made to fall at any moment—or its gait could be broken by lashing it with the whip, which all the spectators would take to be a desperate effort to keep it in the lead. There were scores of such tricks; and sometimes it was the owners who played them and made fortunes, sometimes it was the jockeys and trainers, sometimes it was outsiders, who bribed them—but most of the time it was the chiefs of the trust. Now for instance, they were having winter racing in New Orleans and a syndicate was laying out each day’s program in advance, and its agents in all the Northern cities were “milking” the poolrooms. The word came by long-distance telephone in a cipher code, just a little while before each race; and any man who could get the secret had as good as a fortune. If Jurgis did not believe it, he could try it, said the little Jew—let them meet at a certain house on the morrow and make a test. Jurgis was willing, and so was Duane, and so they went to one of the high-class poolrooms where brokers and merchants gambled (with society women in a private room), and they put up ten dollars each upon a horse called “Black Beldame,” a six to one shot, and won. For a secret like that they would have done a good many sluggings—but the next day Goldberger informed them that the offending gambler had got wind of what was coming to him, and had skipped the town.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002283\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002283\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002284\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002284\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>There were ups and downs at the business; but there was always a living, inside of a jail, if not out of it. Early in April the city elections were due, and that meant prosperity for all the powers of graft. Jurgis, hanging round in dives and gambling houses and brothels, met with the heelers of both parties, and from their conversation he came to understand all the ins and outs of the game, and to hear of a number of ways in which he could make himself useful about election time. “Buck” Halloran was a “Democrat,” and so Jurgis became a Democrat also; but he was not a bitter one—the Republicans were good fellows, too, and were to have a pile of money in this next campaign. At the last election the Republicans had paid four dollars a vote to the Democrats’ three; and “Buck” Halloran sat one night playing cards with Jurgis and another man, who told how Halloran had been charged with the job voting a “bunch” of thirty-seven newly landed Italians, and how he, the narrator, had met the Republican worker who was after the very same gang, and how the three had effected a bargain, whereby the Italians were to vote half and half, for a glass of beer apiece, while the balance of the fund went to the conspirators!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002285\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002285\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002286\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002286\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Not long after this, Jurgis, wearying of the risks and vicissitudes of miscellaneous crime, was moved to give up the career for that of a politician. Just at this time there was a tremendous uproar being raised concerning the alliance between the criminals and the police. For the criminal graft was one in which the business men had no direct part—it was what is called a “side line,” carried by the police. “Wide open” gambling and debauchery made the city pleasing to “trade,” but burglaries and holdups did not. One night it chanced that while Jack Duane was drilling a safe in a clothing store he was caught red-handed by the night watchman, and turned over to a policeman, who chanced to know him well, and who took the responsibility of letting him make his escape. Such a howl from the newspapers followed this that Duane was slated for sacrifice, and barely got out of town in time. And just at that juncture it happened that Jurgis was introduced to a man named Harper whom he recognized as the night watchman at Brown’s, who had been instrumental in making him an American citizen, the first year of his arrival at the yards. The other was interested in the coincidence, but did not remember Jurgis—he had handled too many “green ones” in his time, he said. He sat in a dance hall with Jurgis and Halloran until one or two in the morning, exchanging experiences. He had a long story to tell of his quarrel with the superintendent of his department, and how he was now a plain workingman, and a good union man as well. It was not until some months afterward that Jurgis understood that the quarrel with the superintendent had been prearranged, and that Harper was in reality drawing a salary of twenty dollars a week from the packers for an inside report of his union’s secret proceedings. The yards were seething with agitation just then, said the man, speaking as a unionist. The people of Packingtown had borne about all that they would bear, and it looked as if a strike might begin any week.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002287\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002287\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002288\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002288\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After this talk the man made inquiries concerning Jurgis, and a couple of days later he came to him with an interesting proposition. He was not absolutely certain, he said, but he thought that he could get him a regular salary if he would come to Packingtown and do as he was told, and keep his mouth shut. Harper—“Bush” Harper, he was called—was a right-hand man of Mike Scully, the Democratic boss of the stockyards; and in the coming election there was a peculiar situation. There had come to Scully a proposition to nominate a certain rich brewer who lived upon a swell boulevard that skirted the district, and who coveted the big badge and the “honorable” of an alderman. The brewer was a Jew, and had no brains, but he was harmless, and would put up a rare campaign fund. Scully had accepted the offer, and then gone to the Republicans with a proposition. He was not sure that he could manage the “sheeny,” and he did not mean to take any chances with his district; let the Republicans nominate a certain obscure but amiable friend of Scully’s, who was now setting tenpins in the cellar of an Ashland Avenue saloon, and he, Scully, would elect him with the “sheeny’s” money, and the Republicans might have the glory, which was more than they would get otherwise. In return for this the Republicans would agree to put up no candidate the following year, when Scully himself came up for reelection as the other alderman from the ward. To this the Republicans had assented at once; but the hell of it was—so Harper explained—that the Republicans were all of them fools—a man had to be a fool to be a Republican in the stockyards, where Scully was king. And they didn’t know how to work, and of course it would not do for the Democratic workers, the noble redskins of the War Whoop League, to support the Republican openly. The difficulty would not have been so great except for another fact—there had been a curious development in stockyards politics in the last year or two, a new party having leaped into being. They were the Socialists; and it was a devil of a mess, said “Bush” Harper. The one image which the word “Socialist” brought to Jurgis was of poor little Tamoszius Kuszleika, who had called himself one, and would go out with a couple of other men and a soap-box, and shout himself hoarse on a street corner Saturday nights. Tamoszius had tried to explain to Jurgis what it was all about, but Jurgis, who was not of an imaginative turn, had never quite got it straight; at present he was content with his companion’s explanation that the Socialists were the enemies of American institutions—could not be bought, and would not combine or make any sort of a “dicker.” Mike Scully was very much worried over the opportunity which his last deal gave to them—the stockyards Democrats were furious at the idea of a rich capitalist for their candidate, and while they were changing they might possibly conclude that a Socialist firebrand was preferable to a Republican bum. And so right here was a chance for Jurgis to make himself a place in the world, explained “Bush” Harper; he had been a union man, and he was known in the yards as a workingman; he must have hundreds of acquaintances, and as he had never talked politics with them he might come out as a Republican now without exciting the least suspicion. There were barrels of money for the use of those who could deliver the goods; and Jurgis might count upon Mike Scully, who had never yet gone back on a friend. Just what could he do? Jurgis asked, in some perplexity, and the other explained in detail. To begin with, he would have to go to the yards and work, and he mightn’t relish that; but he would have what he earned, as well as the rest that came to him. He would get active in the union again, and perhaps try to get an office, as he, Harper, had; he would tell all his friends the good points of Doyle, the Republican nominee, and the bad ones of the “sheeny”; and then Scully would furnish a meeting place, and he would start the “Young Men’s Republican Association,” or something of that sort, and have the rich brewer’s best beer by the hogshead, and fireworks and speeches, just like the War Whoop League. Surely Jurgis must know hundreds of men who would like that sort of fun; and there would be the regular Republican leaders and workers to help him out, and they would deliver a big enough majority on election day.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002289\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002289\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002290\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002290\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>When he had heard all this explanation to the end, Jurgis demanded: “But how can I get a job in Packingtown?

Doyle had done him a good turn once, he explained, and was really a bully chap; Doyle was a workingman himself, and would represent the workingmen—why did they want to vote for a millionaire “sheeny,” and what the hell had Mike Scully ever done for them that they should back his candidates all the time? And meantime Scully had given Jurgis a note to the Republican leader of the ward, and he had gone there and met the crowd he was to work with. Already they had hired a big hall, with some of the brewer’s money, and every night Jurgis brought in a dozen new members of the “Doyle Republican Association.” Pretty soon they had a grand opening night; and there was a brass band, which marched through the streets, and fireworks and bombs and red lights in front of the hall; and there was an enormous crowd, with two overflow meetings—so that the pale and trembling candidate had to recite three times over the little speech which one of Scully’s henchmen had written, and which he had been a month learning by heart. Best of all, the famous and eloquent Senator Spareshanks, presidential candidate, rode out in an automobile to discuss the sacred privileges of American citizenship, and protection and prosperity for the American workingman. His inspiriting address was quoted to the extent of half a column in all the morning newspapers, which also said that it could be stated upon excellent authority that the unexpected popularity developed by Doyle, the Republican candidate for alderman, was giving great anxiety to Mr. Scully, the chairman of the Democratic City Committee.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002329\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002329\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002330\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002330\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The chairman was still more worried when the monster torchlight procession came off, with the members of the Doyle Republican Association all in red capes and hats, and free beer for every voter in the ward—the best beer ever given away in a political campaign, as the whole electorate testified. During this parade, and at innumerable cart-tail meetings as well, Jurgis labored tirelessly. He did not make any speeches—there were lawyers and other experts for that—but he helped to manage things; distributing notices and posting placards and bringing out the crowds; and when the show was on he attended to the fireworks and the beer. Thus in the course of the campaign he handled many hundreds of dollars of the Hebrew brewer’s money, administering it with naïve and touching fidelity. Toward the end, however, he learned that he was regarded with hatred by the rest of the “boys,” because he compelled them either to make a poorer showing than he or to do without their share of the pie.

During all this time the same man and woman would dance together, half-stupefied with sensuality and drink.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002342\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002342\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002343\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002343\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Before long Jurgis discovered what Scully had meant by something “turning up.” In May the agreement between the packers and the unions expired, and a new agreement had to be signed. Negotiations were going on, and the yards were full of talk of a strike. The old scale had dealt with the wages of the skilled men only; and of the members of the Meat Workers’ Union about two-thirds were unskilled men. In Chicago these latter were receiving, for the most part, eighteen and a half cents an hour, and the unions wished to make this the general wage for the next year. It was not nearly so large a wage as it seemed—in the course of the negotiations the union officers examined time checks to the amount of ten thousand dollars, and they found that the highest wages paid had been fourteen dollars a week, and the lowest two dollars and five cents, and the average of the whole, six dollars and sixty-five cents. And six dollars and sixty-five cents was hardly too much for a man to keep a family on, considering the fact that the price of dressed meat had increased nearly fifty per cent in the last five years, while the price of “beef on the hoof” had decreased as much, it would have seemed that the packers ought to be able to pay it; but the packers were unwilling to pay it—they rejected the union demand, and to show what their purpose was, a week or two after the agreement expired they put down the wages of about a thousand men to sixteen and a half cents, and it was said that old man Jones had vowed he would put them to fifteen before he got through. There were a million and a half of men in the country looking for work, a hundred thousand of them right in Chicago; and were the packers to let the union stewards march into their places and bind them to a contract that would lose them several thousand dollars a day for a year? Not much!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002344\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002344\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002345\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002345\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>All this was in June; and before long the question was submitted to a referendum in the unions, and the decision was for a strike.

All sorts of pleas for a reconsideration were made, but the packers were obdurate; and all the while they were reducing wages, and heading off shipments of cattle, and rushing in wagon-loads of mattresses and cots. So the men boiled over, and one night telegrams went out from the union headquarters to all the big packing centers—to St. Paul, South Omaha, Sioux City, St. Joseph, Kansas City, East St. Louis, and New York—and the next day at noon between fifty and sixty thousand men drew off their working clothes and marched out of the factories, and the great “Beef Strike” was on.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002346\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002346\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002347\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002347\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Jurgis went to his dinner, and afterward he walked over to see Mike Scully, who lived in a fine house, upon a street which had been decently paved and lighted for his especial benefit.

The resemblance was not complete, of course, for Jurgis was generously paid and comfortably clad, and was provided with a spring cot and a mattress and three substantial meals a day; also he was perfectly at ease, and safe from all peril of life and limb, save only in the case that a desire for beer should lead him to venture outside of the stockyards gates. And even in the exercise of this privilege he was not left unprotected; a good part of the inadequate police force of Chicago was suddenly diverted from its work of hunting criminals, and rushed out to serve him. The police, and the strikers also, were determined that there should be no violence; but there was another party interested which was minded to the contrary—and that was the press. On the first day of his life as a strikebreaker Jurgis quit work early, and in a spirit of bravado he challenged three men of his acquaintance to go outside and get a drink. They accepted, and went through the big Halsted Street gate, where several policemen were watching, and also some union pickets, scanning sharply those who passed in and out. Jurgis and his companions went south on Halsted Street; past the hotel, and then suddenly half a dozen men started across the street toward them and proceeded to argue with them concerning the error of their ways. As the arguments were not taken in the proper spirit, they went on to threats; and suddenly one of them jerked off the hat of one of the four and flung it over the fence. The man started after it, and then, as a cry of “Scab!” was raised and a dozen people came running out of saloons and doorways, a second man’s heart failed him and he followed. Jurgis and the fourth stayed long enough to give themselves the satisfaction of a quick exchange of blows, and then they, too, took to their heels and fled back of the hotel and into the yards again.

Frequently, in the course of a two or three days’ trip, in hot weather and without water, some hog would develop cholera, and die; and the rest would attack him before he had ceased kicking, and when the car was opened there would be nothing of him left but the bones. If all the hogs in this carload were not killed at once, they would soon be down with the dread disease, and there would be nothing to do but make them into lard. It was the same with cattle that were gored and dying, or were limping with broken bones stuck through their flesh—they must be killed, even if brokers and buyers and superintendents had to take off their coats and help drive and cut and skin them. And meantime, agents of the packers were gathering gangs of Negroes in the country districts of the far South, promising them five dollars a day and board, and being careful not to mention there was a strike; already carloads of them were on the way, with special rates from the railroads, and all traffic ordered out of the way. Many towns and cities were taking advantage of the chance to clear out their jails and workhouses—in Detroit the magistrates would release every man who agreed to leave town within twenty-four hours, and agents of the packers were in the courtrooms to ship them right. And meantime trainloads of supplies were coming in for their accommodation, including beer and whisky, so that they might not be tempted to go outside. They hired thirty young girls in Cincinnati to “pack fruit,” and when they arrived put them at work canning corned beef, and put cots for them to sleep in a public hallway, through which the men passed. As the gangs came in day and night, under the escort of squads of police, they stowed away in unused workrooms and storerooms, and in the car sheds, crowded so closely together that the cots touched. In some places they would use the same room for eating and sleeping, and at night the men would put their cots upon the tables, to keep away from the swarms of rats.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002414\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002414\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002415\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002415\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But with all their best efforts, the packers were demoralized.

Each time, of course, there were louder murmurings and angrier looks. Over where the cattle butchers were waiting, Jurgis heard shouts and saw a crowd, and he hurried there. One big butcher, who was president of the Packing Trades Council, had been passed over five times, and the men were wild with rage; they had appointed a committee of three to go in and see the superintendent, and the committee had made three attempts, and each time the police had clubbed them back from the door. Then there were yells and hoots, continuing until at last the superintendent came to the door. “We all go back or none of us do!” cried a hundred voices.

Yet ten years before, when there were no unions in Packingtown, there was a strike, and national troops had to be called, and there were pitched battles fought at night, by the light of blazing freight trains. Packingtown was always a center of violence; in “Whisky Point,” where there were a hundred saloons and one glue factory, there was always fighting, and always more of it in hot weather. Any one who had taken the trouble to consult the station house blotter would have found that there was less violence that summer than ever before—and this while twenty thousand men were out of work, and with nothing to do all day but brood upon bitter wrongs. There was no one to picture the battle the union leaders were fighting—to hold this huge army in rank, to keep it from straggling and pillaging, to cheer and encourage and guide a hundred thousand people, of a dozen different tongues, through six long weeks of hunger and disappointment and despair.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002424\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002424\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002425\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002425\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Meantime the packers had set themselves definitely to the task of making a new labor force.

There was a law forbidding the use of buildings as lodginghouses unless they were licensed for the purpose, and provided with proper windows, stairways, and fire escapes; but here, in a “paint room,” reached only by an enclosed “chute,” a room without a single window and only one door, a hundred men were crowded upon mattresses on the floor. Up on the third story of the “hog house” of Jones’s was a storeroom, without a window, into which they crowded seven hundred men, sleeping upon the bare springs of cots, and with a second shift to use them by day.

Every night there were stabbings and shootings; it was said that the packers had blank permits, which enabled them to ship dead bodies from the city without troubling the authorities. They lodged men and women on the same floor; and with the night there began a saturnalia of debauchery—scenes such as never before had been witnessed in America.

If he fled into a house his pursuer would smash in the flimsy door and follow him up the stairs, hitting every one who came within reach, and finally dragging his squealing quarry from under a bed or a pile of old clothes in a closet.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002438\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002438\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002439\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002439\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Jurgis and two policemen chased some men into a bar-room. One of them took shelter behind the bar, where a policeman cornered him and proceeded to whack him over the back and shoulders, until he lay down and gave a chance at his head. The others leaped a fence in the rear, balking the second policeman, who was fat; and as he came back, furious and cursing, a big Polish woman, the owner of the saloon, rushed in screaming, and received a poke in the stomach that doubled her up on the floor. Meantime Jurgis, who was of a practical temper, was helping himself at the bar; and the first policeman, who had laid out his man, joined him, handing out several more bottles, and filling his pockets besides, and then, as he started to leave, cleaning off all the balance with a sweep of his club. The din of the glass crashing to the floor brought the fat Polish woman to her feet again, but another policeman came up behind her and put his knee into her back and his hands over her eyes—and then called to his companion, who went back and broke open the cash drawer and filled his pockets with the contents. Then the three went outside, and the man who was holding the woman gave her a shove and dashed out himself. The gang having already got the carcass on to the truck, the party set out at a trot, followed by screams and curses, and a shower of bricks and stones from unseen enemies. These bricks and stones would figure in the accounts of the “riot” which would be sent out to a few thousand newspapers within an hour or two; but the episode of the cash drawer would never be mentioned again, save only in the heartbreaking legends of Packingtown.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002440\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002440\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002441\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002441\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was late in the afternoon when they got back, and they dressed out the remainder of the steer, and a couple of others that had been killed, and then knocked off for the day.

So the bail was reduced to three hundred dollars, and Harper went on it himself; he did not tell this to Jurgis, however—nor did he tell him that when the time for trial came it would be an easy matter for him to avoid the forfeiting of the bail, and pocket the three hundred dollars as his reward for the risk of offending Mike Scully! All that he told Jurgis was that he was now free, and that the best thing he could do was to clear out as quickly as possible; and so Jurgis overwhelmed with gratitude and relief, took the dollar and fourteen cents that was left him out of all his bank account, and put it with the two dollars and quarter that was left from his last night’s celebration, and boarded a streetcar and got off at the other end of Chicago.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002500\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002500\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002501\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002501\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002502\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002502\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002503\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002503\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002504\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002504\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Poor Jurgis was now an outcast and a tramp once more.

And then there was the strike, with seventy thousand men and women all over the country idle for a couple of months—twenty thousand in Chicago, and many of them now seeking work throughout the city. It did not remedy matters that a few days later the strike was given up and about half the strikers went back to work; for every one taken on, there was a “scab” who gave up and fled. The ten or fifteen thousand “green” Negroes, foreigners, and criminals were now being turned loose to shift for themselves. Everywhere Jurgis went he kept meeting them, and he was in an agony of fear lest some one of them should know that he was “wanted.” He would have left Chicago, only by the time he had realized his danger he was almost penniless; and it would be better to go to jail than to be caught out in the country in the winter time.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002509\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002509\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002510\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002510\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>At the end of about ten days Jurgis had only a few pennies left; and he had not yet found a job—not even a day’s work at anything, not a chance to carry a satchel.

Yet when he had thought of all humanity as vile and hideous, he had somehow always excepted his own family that he had loved; and now this sudden horrible discovery—Marija a whore, and Elzbieta and the children living off her shame! Jurgis might argue with himself all he chose, that he had done worse, and was a fool for caring—but still he could not get over the shock of that sudden unveiling, he could not help being sunk in grief because of it. The depths of him were troubled and shaken, memories were stirred in him that had been sleeping so long he had counted them dead. Memories of the old life—his old hopes and his old yearnings, his old dreams of decency and independence! He saw Ona again, he heard her gentle voice pleading with him. He saw little Antanas, whom he had meant to make a man. He saw his trembling old father, who had blessed them all with his wonderful love. He lived again through that day of horror when he had discovered Ona’s shame—God, how he had suffered, what a madman he had been! How dreadful it had all seemed to him; and now, today, he had sat and listened, and half agreed when Marija told him he had been a fool! Yes—told him that he ought to have sold his wife’s honor and lived by it!—And then there was Stanislovas and his awful fate—that brief story which Marija had narrated so calmly, with such dull indifference! The poor little fellow, with his frostbitten fingers and his terror of the snow—his wailing voice rang in Jurgis’s ears, as he lay there in the darkness, until the sweat started on his forehead. Now and then he would quiver with a sudden spasm of horror, at the picture of little Stanislovas shut up in the deserted building and fighting for his life with the rats!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002709\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002709\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002710\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002710\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>All these emotions had become strangers to the soul of Jurgis; it was so long since they had troubled him that he had ceased to think they might ever trouble him again. Helpless, trapped, as he was, what good did they do him—why should he ever have allowed them to torment him? It had been the task of his recent life to fight them down, to crush them out of him; never in his life would he have suffered from them again, save that they had caught him unawares, and overwhelmed him before he could protect himself. He heard the old voices of his soul, he saw its old ghosts beckoning to him, stretching out their arms to him! But they were far-off and shadowy, and the gulf between them was black and bottomless; they would fade away into the mists of the past once more. Their voices would die, and never again would he hear them—and so the last faint spark of manhood in his soul would flicker out.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002711\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002711\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002712\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002712\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002713\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002713\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002714\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002714\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002715\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002715\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After breakfast Jurgis was driven to the court, which was crowded with the prisoners and those who had come out of curiosity or in the hope of recognizing one of the men and getting a case for blackmail.

It was in this very same court that he had been tried, that time when his sentence had been “suspended”; it was the same judge, and the same clerk. The latter now stared at Jurgis, as if he half thought that he knew him; but the judge had no suspicions—just then his thoughts were upon a telephone message he was expecting from a friend of the police captain of the district, telling what disposition he should make of the case of “Polly” Simpson, as the “madame” of the house was known. Meantime, he listened to the story of how Jurgis had been looking for his sister, and advised him dryly to keep his sister in a better place; then he let him go, and proceeded to fine each of the girls five dollars, which fines were paid in a bunch from a wad of bills which Madame Polly extracted from her stocking.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002716\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002716\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002717\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002717\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Jurgis waited outside and walked home with Marija.

But suddenly it seemed as if the speaker had begun pointing straight at him, as if he had singled him out particularly for his remarks; and so Jurgis became suddenly aware of his voice, trembling, vibrant with emotion, with pain and longing, with a burden of things unutterable, not to be compassed by words. To hear it was to be suddenly arrested, to be gripped, transfixed.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002806\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002806\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002807\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002807\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“You listen to these things,” the man was saying, “and you say, ‘Yes, they are true, but they have been that way always.’ Or you say, ‘Maybe it will come, but not in my time—it will not help me.’ And so you return to your daily round of toil, you go back to be ground up for profits in the world-wide mill of economic might! To toil long hours for another’s advantage; to live in mean and squalid homes, to work in dangerous and unhealthful places; to wrestle with the specters of hunger and privation, to take your chances of accident, disease, and death. And each day the struggle becomes fiercer, the pace more cruel; each day you have to toil a little harder, and feel the iron hand of circumstance close upon you a little tighter. Months pass, years maybe—and then you come again; and again I am here to plead with you, to know if want and misery have yet done their work with you, if injustice and oppression have yet opened your eyes! I shall still be waiting—there is nothing else that I can do. There is no wilderness where I can hide from these things, there is no haven where I can escape them; though I travel to the ends of the earth, I find the same accursed system—I find that all the fair and noble impulses of humanity, the dreams of poets and the agonies of martyrs, are shackled and bound in the service of organized and predatory Greed! And therefore I cannot rest, I cannot be silent; therefore I cast aside comfort and happiness, health and good repute—and go out into the world and cry out the pain of my spirit! Therefore I am not to be silenced by poverty and sickness, not by hatred and obloquy, by threats and ridicule—not by prison and persecution, if they should come—not by any power that is upon the earth or above the earth, that was, or is, or ever can be created. If I fail tonight, I can only try tomorrow; knowing that the fault must be mine—that if once the vision of my soul were spoken upon earth, if once the anguish of its defeat were uttered in human speech, it would break the stoutest barriers of prejudice, it would shake the most sluggish soul to action! It would abash the most cynical, it would terrify the most selfish; and the voice of mockery would be silenced, and fraud and falsehood would slink back into their dens, and the truth would stand forth alone! For I speak with the voice of the millions who are voiceless! Of them that are oppressed and have no comforter! Of the disinherited of life, for whom there is no respite and no deliverance, to whom the world is a prison, a dungeon of torture, a tomb! With the voice of the little child who toils tonight in a Southern cotton mill, staggering with exhaustion, numb with agony, and knowing no hope but the grave! Of the mother who sews by candlelight in her tenement garret, weary and weeping, smitten with the mortal hunger of her babes! Of the man who lies upon a bed of rags, wrestling in his last sickness and leaving his loved ones to perish! Of the young girl who, somewhere at this moment, is walking the streets of this horrible city, beaten and starving, and making her choice between the brothel and the lake! With the voice of those, whoever and wherever they may be, who are caught beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of Greed! With the voice of humanity, calling for deliverance! Of the everlasting soul of Man, arising from the dust; breaking its way out of its prison—rending the bands of oppression and ignorance—groping its way to the light!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002808\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002808\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002809\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002809\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The speaker paused.

To you, working-men! To you, the toilers, who have made this land, and have no voice in its councils! To you, whose lot it is to sow that others may reap, to labor and obey, and ask no more than the wages of a beast of burden, the food and shelter to keep you alive from day to day. It is to you that I come with my message of salvation, it is to you that I appeal. I know how much it is to ask of you—I know, for I have been in your place, I have lived your life, and there is no man before me here tonight who knows it better. I have known what it is to be a street-waif, a bootblack, living upon a crust of bread and sleeping in cellar stairways and under empty wagons. I have known what it is to dare and to aspire, to dream mighty dreams and to see them perish—to see all the fair flowers of my spirit trampled into the mire by the wild-beast powers of my life. I know what is the price that a working-man pays for knowledge—I have paid for it with food and sleep, with agony of body and mind, with health, almost with life itself; and so, when I come to you with a story of hope and freedom, with the vision of a new earth to be created, of a new labor to be dared, I am not surprised that I find you sordid and material, sluggish and incredulous. That I do not despair is because I know also the forces that are driving behind you—because I know the raging lash of poverty, the sting of contempt and mastership, ‘the insolence of office and the spurns.’ Because I feel sure that in the crowd that has come to me tonight, no matter how many may be dull and heedless, no matter how many may have come out of idle curiosity, or in order to ridicule—there will be some one man whom pain and suffering have made desperate, whom some chance vision of wrong and horror has startled and shocked into attention. And to him my words will come like a sudden flash of lightning to one who travels in darkness—revealing the way before him, the perils and the obstacles—solving all problems, making all difficulties clear! The scales will fall from his eyes, the shackles will be torn from his limbs—he will leap up with a cry of thankfulness, he will stride forth a free man at last! A man delivered from his self-created slavery! A man who will never more be trapped—whom no blandishments will cajole, whom no threats will frighten; who from tonight on will move forward, and not backward, who will study and understand, who will gird on his sword and take his place in the army of his comrades and brothers. Who will carry the good tidings to others, as I have carried them to him—priceless gift of liberty and light that is neither mine nor his, but is the heritage of the soul of man! Working-men, working-men—comrades! open your eyes and look about you! You have lived so long in the toil and heat that your senses are dulled, your souls are numbed; but realize once in your lives this world in which you dwell—tear off the rags of its customs and conventions—behold it as it is, in all its hideous nakedness! Realize it, <i>realize it!</i> Realize that out upon the plains of Manchuria tonight two hostile armies are facing each other—that now, while we are seated here, a million human beings may be hurled at each other’s throats, striving with the fury of maniacs to tear each other to pieces! And this in the twentieth century, nineteen hundred years since the Prince of Peace was born on earth! Nineteen hundred years that his words have been preached as divine, and here two armies of men are rending and tearing each other like the wild beasts of the forest! Philosophers have reasoned, prophets have denounced, poets have wept and pleaded—and still this hideous Monster roams at large! We have schools and colleges, newspapers and books; we have searched the heavens and the earth, we have weighed and probed and reasoned—and all to equip men to destroy each other! We call it War, and pass it by—but do not put me off with platitudes and conventions—come with me, come with me—<i>realize it!</i> See the bodies of men pierced by bullets, blown into pieces by bursting shells! Hear the crunching of the bayonet, plunged into human flesh; hear the groans and shrieks of agony, see the faces of men crazed by pain, turned into fiends by fury and hate! Put your hand upon that piece of flesh—it is hot and quivering—just now it was a part of a man! This blood is still steaming—it was driven by a human heart! Almighty God! and this goes on—it is systematic, organized, premeditated! And we know it, and read of it, and take it for granted; our papers tell of it, and the presses are not stopped—our churches know of it, and do not close their doors—the people behold it, and do not rise up in horror and revolution!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002814\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002814\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002815\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002815\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Or perhaps Manchuria is too far away for you—come home with me then, come here to Chicago. Here in this city to-night ten thousand women are shut up in foul pens, and driven by hunger to sell their bodies to live. And we know it, we make it a jest! And these women are made in the image of your mothers, they may be your sisters, your daughters; the child whom you left at home tonight, whose laughing eyes will greet you in the morning—that fate may be waiting for her! To-night in Chicago there are ten thousand men, homeless and wretched, willing to work and begging for a chance, yet starving, and fronting in terror the awful winter cold! Tonight in Chicago there are a hundred thousand children wearing out their strength and blasting their lives in the effort to earn their bread! There are a hundred thousand mothers who are living in misery and squalor, struggling to earn enough to feed their little ones! There are a hundred thousand old people, cast off and helpless, waiting for death to take them from their torments! There are a million people, men and women and children, who share the curse of the wage-slave; who toil every hour they can stand and see, for just enough to keep them alive; who are condemned till the end of their days to monotony and weariness, to hunger and misery, to heat and cold, to dirt and disease, to ignorance and drunkenness and vice! And then turn over the page with me, and gaze upon the other side of the picture. There are a thousand—ten thousand, maybe—who are the masters of these slaves, who own their toil. They do nothing to earn what they receive, they do not even have to ask for it—it comes to them of itself, their only care is to dispose of it. They live in palaces, they riot in luxury and extravagance—such as no words can describe, as makes the imagination reel and stagger, makes the soul grow sick and faint. They spend hundreds of dollars for a pair of shoes, a handkerchief, a garter; they spend millions for horses and automobiles and yachts, for palaces and banquets, for little shiny stones with which to deck their bodies. Their life is a contest among themselves for supremacy in ostentation and recklessness, in the destroying of useful and necessary things, in the wasting of the labor and the lives of their fellow creatures, the toil and anguish of the nations, the sweat and tears and blood of the human race! It is all theirs—it comes to them; just as all the springs pour into streamlets, and the streamlets into rivers, and the rivers into the oceans—so, automatically and inevitably, all the wealth of society comes to them. The farmer tills the soil, the miner digs in the earth, the weaver tends the loom, the mason carves the stone; the clever man invents, the shrewd man directs, the wise man studies, the inspired man sings—and all the result, the products of the labor of brain and muscle, are gathered into one stupendous stream and poured into their laps! The whole of society is in their grip, the whole labor of the world lies at their mercy—and like fierce wolves they rend and destroy, like ravening vultures they devour and tear! The whole power of mankind belongs to them, forever and beyond recall—do what it can, strive as it will, humanity lives for them and dies for them! They own not merely the labor of society, they have bought the governments; and everywhere they use their raped and stolen power to intrench themselves in their privileges, to dig wider and deeper the channels through which the river of profits flows to them!—And you, workingmen, workingmen! You have been brought up to it, you plod on like beasts of burden, thinking only of the day and its pain—yet is there a man among you who can believe that such a system will continue forever—is there a man here in this audience tonight so hardened and debased that he dare rise up before me and say that he believes it can continue forever; that the product of the labor of society, the means of existence of the human race, will always belong to idlers and parasites, to be spent for the gratification of vanity and lust—to be spent for any purpose whatever, to be at the disposal of any individual will whatever—that somehow, somewhere, the labor of humanity will not belong to humanity, to be used for the purposes of humanity, to be controlled by the will of humanity? And if this is ever to be, how is it to be—what power is there that will bring it about? Will it be the task of your masters, do you think—will they write the charter of your liberties? Will they forge you the sword of your deliverance, will they marshal you the army and lead it to the fray? Will their wealth be spent for the purpose—will they build colleges and churches to teach you, will they print papers to herald your progress, and organize political parties to guide and carry on the struggle? Can you not see that the task is your task—yours to dream, yours to resolve, yours to execute? That if ever it is carried out, it will be in the face of every obstacle that wealth and mastership can oppose—in the face of ridicule and slander, of hatred and persecution, of the bludgeon and the jail? That it will be by the power of your naked bosoms, opposed to the rage of oppression! By the grim and bitter teaching of blind and merciless affliction! By the painful gropings of the untutored mind, by the feeble stammerings of the uncultured voice! By the sad and lonely hunger of the spirit; by seeking and striving and yearning, by heartache and despairing, by agony and sweat of blood! It will be by money paid for with hunger, by knowledge stolen from sleep, by thoughts communicated under the shadow of the gallows! It will be a movement beginning in the far-off past, a thing obscure and unhonored, a thing easy to ridicule, easy to despise; a thing unlovely, wearing the aspect of vengeance and hate—but to you, the working-man, the wage-slave, calling with a voice insistent, imperious—with a voice that you cannot escape, wherever upon the earth you may be! With the voice of all your wrongs, with the voice of all your desires; with the voice of your duty and your hope—of everything in the world that is worth while to you! The voice of the poor, demanding that poverty shall cease! The voice of the oppressed, pronouncing the doom of oppression! The voice of power, wrought out of suffering—of resolution, crushed out of weakness—of joy and courage, born in the bottomless pit of anguish and despair! The voice of Labor, despised and outraged; a mighty giant, lying prostrate—mountainous, colossal, but blinded, bound, and ignorant of his strength. And now a dream of resistance haunts him, hope battling with fear; until suddenly he stirs, and a fetter snaps—and a thrill shoots through him, to the farthest ends of his huge body, and in a flash the dream becomes an act! He starts, he lifts himself; and the bands are shattered, the burdens roll off him—he rises—towering, gigantic; he springs to his feet, he shouts in his newborn exultation—”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002816\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002816\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002817\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002817\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And the speaker’s voice broke suddenly, with the stress of his feelings; he stood with his arms stretched out above him, and the power of his vision seemed to lift him from the floor. The audience came to its feet with a yell; men waved their arms, laughing aloud in their excitement. And Jurgis was with them, he was shouting to tear his throat; shouting because he could not help it, because the stress of his feeling was more than he could bear. It was not merely the man’s words, the torrent of his eloquence. It was his presence, it was his voice: a voice with strange intonations that rang through the chambers of the soul like the clanging of a bell—that gripped the listener like a mighty hand about his body, that shook him and startled him with sudden fright, with a sense of things not of earth, of mysteries never spoken before, of presences of awe and terror! There was an unfolding of vistas before him, a breaking of the ground beneath him, an upheaving, a stirring, a trembling; he felt himself suddenly a mere man no longer—there were powers within him undreamed of, there were demon forces contending, age-long wonders struggling to be born; and he sat oppressed with pain and joy, while a tingling stole down into his finger tips, and his breath came hard and fast. The sentences of this man were to Jurgis like the crashing of thunder in his soul; a flood of emotions surged up in him—all his old hopes and longings, his old griefs and rages and despairs. All that he had ever felt in his whole life seemed to come back to him at once, and with one new emotion, hardly to be described. That he should have suffered such oppressions and such horrors was bad enough; but that he should have been crushed and beaten by them, that he should have submitted, and forgotten, and lived in peace—ah, truly that was a thing not to be put into words, a thing not to be borne by a human creature, a thing of terror and madness! “What,” asks the prophet, “is the murder of them that kill the body, to the murder of them that kill the soul?” And Jurgis was a man whose soul had been murdered, who had ceased to hope and to struggle—who had made terms with degradation and despair; and now, suddenly, in one awful convulsion, the black and hideous fact was made plain to him! There was a falling in of all the pillars of his soul, the sky seemed to split above him—he stood there, with his clenched hands upraised, his eyes bloodshot, and the veins standing out purple in his face, roaring in the voice of a wild beast, frantic, incoherent, maniacal. And when he could shout no more he still stood there, gasping, and whispering hoarsely to himself: “By God! By God!

Jurgis had never heard it, and he could not make out the words, but the wild and wonderful spirit of it seized upon him—it was the “Marseillaise!” As stanza after stanza of it thundered forth, he sat with his hands clasped, trembling in every nerve. He had never been so stirred in his life—it was a miracle that had been wrought in him. He could not think at all, he was stunned; yet he knew that in the mighty upheaval that had taken place in his soul, a new man had been born. He had been torn out of the jaws of destruction, he had been delivered from the thraldom of despair; the whole world had been changed for him—he was free, he was free! Even if he were to suffer as he had before, even if he were to beg and starve, nothing would be the same to him; he would understand it, and bear it. He would no longer be the sport of circumstances, he would be a man, with a will and a purpose; he would have something to fight for, something to die for, if need be! Here were men who would show him and help him; and he would have friends and allies, he would dwell in the sight of justice, and walk arm in arm with power.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002823\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002823\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002824\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002824\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The audience subsided again, and Jurgis sat back.

The man came forward, and some one—a woman—arose and asked about some opinion the speaker had expressed concerning Tolstoy. Jurgis had never heard of Tolstoy, and did not care anything about him. Why should any one want to ask such questions, after an address like that? The thing was not to talk, but to do; the thing was to get bold of others and rouse them, to organize them and prepare for the fight! But still the discussion went on, in ordinary conversational tones, and it brought Jurgis back to the everyday world.

There was a baby crying as they entered, and he closed the door leading into the bedroom. He had three young children, he explained, and a baby had just come. He drew up two chairs near the kitchen stove, adding that Jurgis must excuse the disorder of the place, since at such a time one’s domestic arrangements were upset. Half of the kitchen was given up to a workbench, which was piled with clothing, and Ostrinski explained that he was a “pants finisher.” He brought great bundles of clothing here to his home, where he and his wife worked on them. He made a living at it, but it was getting harder all the time, because his eyes were failing. What would come when they gave out he could not tell; there had been no saving anything—a man could barely keep alive by twelve or fourteen hours’ work a day. The finishing of pants did not take much skill, and anybody could learn it, and so the pay was forever getting less. That was the competitive wage system; and if Jurgis wanted to understand what Socialism was, it was there he had best begin. The workers were dependent upon a job to exist from day to day, and so they bid against each other, and no man could get more than the lowest man would consent to work for. And thus the mass of the people were always in a life-and-death struggle with poverty. That was “competition,” so far as it concerned the wage-earner, the man who had only his labor to sell; to those on top, the exploiters, it appeared very differently, of course—there were few of them, and they could combine and dominate, and their power would be unbreakable. And so all over the world two classes were forming, with an unbridged chasm between them—the capitalist class, with its enormous fortunes, and the proletariat, bound into slavery by unseen chains. The latter were a thousand to one in numbers, but they were ignorant and helpless, and they would remain at the mercy of their exploiters until they were organized—until they had become “class-conscious.” It was a slow and weary process, but it would go on—it was like the movement of a glacier, once it was started it could never be stopped. Every Socialist did his share, and lived upon the vision of the “good time coming,”—when the working class should go to the polls and seize the powers of government, and put an end to private property in the means of production. No matter how poor a man was, or how much he suffered, he could never be really unhappy while he knew of that future; even if he did not live to see it himself, his children would, and, to a Socialist, the victory of his class was his victory. Also he had always the progress to encourage him; here in Chicago, for instance, the movement was growing by leaps and bounds. Chicago was the industrial center of the country, and nowhere else were the unions so strong; but their organizations did the workers little good, for the employers were organized, also; and so the strikes generally failed, and as fast as the unions were broken up the men were coming over to the Socialists.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002865\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002865\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002866\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002866\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Ostrinski explained the organization of the party, the machinery by which the proletariat was educating itself. There were “locals” in every big city and town, and they were being organized rapidly in the smaller places; a local had anywhere from six to a thousand members, and there were fourteen hundred of them in all, with a total of about twenty-five thousand members, who paid dues to support the organization. “Local Cook County,” as the city organization was called, had eighty branch locals, and it alone was spending several thousand dollars in the campaign. It published a weekly in English, and one each in Bohemian and German; also there was a monthly published in Chicago, and a cooperative publishing house, that issued a million and a half of Socialist books and pamphlets every year. All this was the growth of the last few years—there had been almost nothing of it when Ostrinski first came to Chicago.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002867\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002867\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002868\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002868\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Ostrinski was a Pole, about fifty years of age.

He had had more of his share of the fight, though, for just when Socialism had broken all its barriers and become the great political force of the empire, he had come to America, and begun all over again.

After a while he would realize how hard a task it was; and then it would be fortunate that other new hands kept coming, to save him from settling down into a rut. Just now Jurgis would have plenty of chance to vent his excitement, for a presidential campaign was on, and everybody was talking politics. Ostrinski would take him to the next meeting of the branch local, and introduce him, and he might join the party. The dues were five cents a week, but any one who could not afford this might be excused from paying. The Socialist party was a really democratic political organization—it was controlled absolutely by its own membership, and had no bosses. All of these things Ostrinski explained, as also the principles of the party. You might say that there was really but one Socialist principle—that of “no compromise,” which was the essence of the proletarian movement all over the world. When a Socialist was elected to office he voted with old party legislators for any measure that was likely to be of help to the working class, but he never forgot that these concessions, whatever they might be, were trifles compared with the great purpose—the organizing of the working class for the revolution. So far, the rule in America had been that one Socialist made another Socialist once every two years; and if they should maintain the same rate they would carry the country in 1912—though not all of them expected to succeed as quickly as that.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002873\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002873\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002874\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002874\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The Socialists were organized in every civilized nation; it was an international political party, said Ostrinski, the greatest the world had ever known. It numbered thirty million of adherents, and it cast eight million votes. It had started its first newspaper in Japan, and elected its first deputy in Argentina; in France it named members of cabinets, and in Italy and Australia it held the balance of power and turned out ministries. In Germany, where its vote was more than a third of the total vote of the empire, all other parties and powers had united to fight it. It would not do, Ostrinski explained, for the proletariat of one nation to achieve the victory, for that nation would be crushed by the military power of the others; and so the Socialist movement was a world movement, an organization of all mankind to establish liberty and fraternity. It was the new religion of humanity—or you might say it was the fulfillment of the old religion, since it implied but the literal application of all the teachings of Christ.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002875\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002875\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002876\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002876\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Until long after midnight Jurgis sat lost in the conversation of his new acquaintance. It was a most wonderful experience to him—an almost supernatural experience. It was like encountering an inhabitant of the fourth dimension of space, a being who was free from all one’s own limitations. For four years, now, Jurgis had been wondering and blundering in the depths of a wilderness; and here, suddenly, a hand reached down and seized him, and lifted him out of it, and set him upon a mountain-top, from which he could survey it all—could see the paths from which he had wandered, the morasses into which he had stumbled, the hiding places of the beasts of prey that had fallen upon him. There were his Packingtown experiences, for instance—what was there about Packingtown that Ostrinski could not explain! To Jurgis the packers had been equivalent to fate; Ostrinski showed him that they were the Beef Trust. They were a gigantic combination of capital, which had crushed all opposition, and overthrown the laws of the land, and was preying upon the people. Jurgis recollected how, when he had first come to Packingtown, he had stood and watched the hog-killing, and thought how cruel and savage it was, and come away congratulating himself that he was not a hog; now his new acquaintance showed him that a hog was just what he had been—one of the packers’ hogs. What they wanted from a hog was all the profits that could be got out of him; and that was what they wanted from the workingman, and also that was what they wanted from the public. What the hog thought of it, and what he suffered, were not considered; and no more was it with labor, and no more with the purchaser of meat. That was true everywhere in the world, but it was especially true in Packingtown; there seemed to be something about the work of slaughtering that tended to ruthlessness and ferocity—it was literally the fact that in the methods of the packers a hundred human lives did not balance a penny of profit. When Jurgis had made himself familiar with the Socialist literature, as he would very quickly, he would get glimpses of the Beef Trust from all sorts of aspects, and he would find it everywhere the same; it was the incarnation of blind and insensate Greed. It was a monster devouring with a thousand mouths, trampling with a thousand hoofs; it was the Great Butcher—it was the spirit of Capitalism made flesh. Upon the ocean of commerce it sailed as a pirate ship; it had hoisted the black flag and declared war upon civilization. Bribery and corruption were its everyday methods. In Chicago the city government was simply one of its branch offices; it stole billions of gallons of city water openly, it dictated to the courts the sentences of disorderly strikers, it forbade the mayor to enforce the building laws against it. In the national capital it had power to prevent inspection of its product, and to falsify government reports; it violated the rebate laws, and when an investigation was threatened it burned its books and sent its criminal agents out of the country. In the commercial world it was a Juggernaut car; it wiped out thousands of businesses every year, it drove men to madness and suicide. It had forced the price of cattle so low as to destroy the stock-raising industry, an occupation upon which whole states existed; it had ruined thousands of butchers who had refused to handle its products. It divided the country into districts, and fixed the price of meat in all of them; and it owned all the refrigerator cars, and levied an enormous tribute upon all poultry and eggs and fruit and vegetables. With the millions of dollars a week that poured in upon it, it was reaching out for the control of other interests, railroads and trolley lines, gas and electric light franchises—it already owned the leather and the grain business of the country. The people were tremendously stirred up over its encroachments, but nobody had any remedy to suggest; it was the task of Socialists to teach and organize them, and prepare them for the time when they were to seize the huge machine called the Beef Trust, and use it to produce food for human beings and not to heap up fortunes for a band of pirates. It was long after midnight when Jurgis lay down upon the floor of Ostrinski’s kitchen; and yet it was an hour before he could get to sleep, for the glory of that joyful vision of the people of Packingtown marching in and taking possession of the Union Stockyards!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002877\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002877\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002878\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002878\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002879\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002879\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002880\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002880\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002881\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002881\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Jurgis had breakfast with Ostrinski and his family, and then he went home to Elzbieta.

At first she thought he was out of his mind, and it was hours before she could really feel certain that he was himself. When, however, she had satisfied herself that he was sane upon all subjects except politics, she troubled herself no further about it. Jurgis was destined to find that Elzbieta’s armor was absolutely impervious to Socialism. Her soul had been baked hard in the fire of adversity, and there was no altering it now; life to her was the hunt for daily bread, and ideas existed for her only as they bore upon that. All that interested her in regard to this new frenzy which had seized hold of her son-in-law was whether or not it had a tendency to make him sober and industrious; and when she found he intended to look for work and to contribute his share to the family fund, she gave him full rein to convince her of anything. A wonderfully wise little woman was Elzbieta; she could think as quickly as a hunted rabbit, and in half an hour she had chosen her life-attitude to the Socialist movement. She agreed in everything with Jurgis, except the need of his paying his dues; and she would even go to a meeting with him now and then, and sit and plan her next day’s dinner amid the storm.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002882\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002882\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002883\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002883\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>For a week after he became a convert Jurgis continued to wander about all day, looking for work; until at last he met with a strange fortune.

He had gone into business, and found himself in competition with the fortunes of those who had been stealing while he had been fighting. The city government was in their hands and the railroads were in league with them, and honest business was driven to the wall; and so Hinds had put all his savings into Chicago real estate, and set out singlehanded to dam the river of graft. He had been a reform member of the city council, he had been a Greenbacker, a Labor Unionist, a Populist, a Bryanite—and after thirty years of fighting, the year 1896 had served to convince him that the power of concentrated wealth could never be controlled, but could only be destroyed. He had published a pamphlet about it, and set out to organize a party of his own, when a stray Socialist leaflet had revealed to him that others had been ahead of him. Now for eight years he had been fighting for the party, anywhere, everywhere—whether it was a G.A.R. reunion, or a hotel-keepers’ convention, or an Afro-American business-men’s banquet, or a Bible society picnic, Tommy Hinds would manage to get himself invited to explain the relations of Socialism to the subject in hand. After that he would start off upon a tour of his own, ending at some place between New York and Oregon; and when he came back from there, he would go out to organize new locals for the state committee; and finally he would come home to rest—and talk Socialism in Chicago. Hinds’s hotel was a very hot-bed of the propaganda; all the employees were party men, and if they were not when they came, they were quite certain to be before they went away. The proprietor would get into a discussion with some one in the lobby, and as the conversation grew animated, others would gather about to listen, until finally every one in the place would be crowded into a group, and a regular debate would be under way. This went on every night—when Tommy Hinds was not there to do it, his clerk did it; and when his clerk was away campaigning, the assistant attended to it, while Mrs. Hinds sat behind the desk and did the work. The clerk was an old crony of the proprietor’s, an awkward, rawboned giant of a man, with a lean, sallow face, a broad mouth, and whiskers under his chin, the very type and body of a prairie farmer. He had been that all his life—he had fought the railroads in Kansas for fifty years, a Granger, a Farmers’ Alliance man, a “middle-of-the-road” Populist. Finally, Tommy Hinds had revealed to him the wonderful idea of using the trusts instead of destroying them, and he had sold his farm and come to Chicago.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002916\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002916\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002917\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002917\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>That was Amos Struver; and then there was Harry Adams, the assistant clerk, a pale, scholarly-looking man, who came from Massachusetts, of Pilgrim stock. Adams had been a cotton operative in Fall River, and the continued depression in the industry had worn him and his family out, and he had emigrated to South Carolina. In Massachusetts the percentage of white illiteracy is eight-tenths of one per cent, while in South Carolina it is thirteen and six-tenths per cent; also in South Carolina there is a property qualification for voters—and for these and other reasons child labor is the rule, and so the cotton mills were driving those of Massachusetts out of the business. Adams did not know this, he only knew that the Southern mills were running; but when he got there he found that if he was to live, all his family would have to work, and from six o’clock at night to six o’clock in the morning. So he had set to work to organize the mill hands, after the fashion in Massachusetts, and had been discharged; but he had gotten other work, and stuck at it, and at last there had been a strike for shorter hours, and Harry Adams had attempted to address a street meeting, which was the end of him. In the states of the far South the labor of convicts is leased to contractors, and when there are not convicts enough they have to be supplied. Harry Adams was sent up by a judge who was a cousin of the mill owner with whose business he had interfered; and though the life had nearly killed him, he had been wise enough not to murmur, and at the end of his term he and his family had left the state of South Carolina—hell’s back yard, as he called it. He had no money for carfare, but it was harvest-time, and they walked one day and worked the next; and so Adams got at last to Chicago, and joined the Socialist party. He was a studious man, reserved, and nothing of an orator; but he always had a pile of books under his desk in the hotel, and articles from his pen were beginning to attract attention in the party press.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002918\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002918\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002919\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002919\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Contrary to what one would have expected, all this radicalism did not hurt the hotel business; the radicals flocked to it, and the commercial travelers all found it diverting. Of late, also, the hotel had become a favorite stopping place for Western cattlemen. Now that the Beef Trust had adopted the trick of raising prices to induce enormous shipments of cattle, and then dropping them again and scooping in all they needed, a stock raiser was very apt to find himself in Chicago without money enough to pay his freight bill; and so he had to go to a cheap hotel, and it was no drawback to him if there was an agitator talking in the lobby. These Western fellows were just “meat” for Tommy Hinds—he would get a dozen of them around him and paint little pictures of “the System.” Of course, it was not a week before he had heard Jurgis’s story, and after that he would not have let his new porter go for the world. “See here,” he would say, in the middle of an argument, “I’ve got a fellow right here in my place who’s worked there and seen every bit of it!” And then Jurgis would drop his work, whatever it was, and come, and the other would say, “Comrade Jurgis, just tell these gentlemen what you saw on the killing-beds.” At first this request caused poor Jurgis the most acute agony, and it was like pulling teeth to get him to talk; but gradually he found out what was wanted, and in the end he learned to stand up and speak his piece with enthusiasm. His employer would sit by and encourage him with exclamations and shakes of the head; when Jurgis would give the formula for “potted ham,” or tell about the condemned hogs that were dropped into the “destructors” at the top and immediately taken out again at the bottom, to be shipped into another state and made into lard, Tommy Hinds would bang his knee and cry, “Do you think a man could make up a thing like that out of his head?”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002920\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002920\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002921\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002921\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then the hotel-keeper would go on to show how the Socialists had the only real remedy for such evils, how they alone “meant business” with the Beef Trust.

And now, at last, two magazines have the courage to tackle ‘Standard Oil’ again, and what happens?

Perhaps you would imagine that he did not do much work there, but that would be a great mistake. He would have cut off one hand for Tommy Hinds; and to keep Hinds’s hotel a thing of beauty was his joy in life. That he had a score of Socialist arguments chasing through his brain in the meantime did not interfere with this; on the contrary, Jurgis scrubbed the spittoons and polished the banisters all the more vehemently because at the same time he was wrestling inwardly with an imaginary recalcitrant. It would be pleasant to record that he swore off drinking immediately, and all the rest of his bad habits with it; but that would hardly be exact. These revolutionists were not angels; they were men, and men who had come up from the social pit, and with the mire of it smeared over them. Some of them drank, and some of them swore, and some of them ate pie with their knives; there was only one difference between them and all the rest of the populace—that they were men with a hope, with a cause to fight for and suffer for. There came times to Jurgis when the vision seemed far-off and pale, and a glass of beer loomed large in comparison; but if the glass led to another glass, and to too many glasses, he had something to spur him to remorse and resolution on the morrow. It was so evidently a wicked thing to spend one’s pennies for drink, when the working class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered; the price of a glass of beer would buy fifty copies of a leaflet, and one could hand these out to the unregenerate, and then get drunk upon the thought of the good that was being accomplished. That was the way the movement had been made, and it was the only way it would progress; it availed nothing to know of it, without fighting for it—it was a thing for all, not for a few! A corollary of this proposition of course was, that any one who refused to receive the new gospel was personally responsible for keeping Jurgis from his heart’s desire; and this, alas, made him uncomfortable as an acquaintance. He met some neighbors with whom Elzbieta had made friends in her neighborhood, and he set out to make Socialists of them by wholesale, and several times he all but got into a fight.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002926\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002926\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002927\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002927\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was all so painfully obvious to Jurgis! It was so incomprehensible how a man could fail to see it! Here were all the opportunities of the country, the land, and the buildings upon the land, the railroads, the mines, the factories, and the stores, all in the hands of a few private individuals, called capitalists, for whom the people were obliged to work for wages. The whole balance of what the people produced went to heap up the fortunes of these capitalists, to heap, and heap again, and yet again—and that in spite of the fact that they, and every one about them, lived in unthinkable luxury! And was it not plain that if the people cut off the share of those who merely “owned,” the share of those who worked would be much greater? That was as plain as two and two makes four; and it was the whole of it, absolutely the whole of it; and yet there were people who could not see it, who would argue about everything else in the world. They would tell you that governments could not manage things as economically as private individuals; they would repeat and repeat that, and think they were saying something! They could not see that “economical” management by masters meant simply that they, the people, were worked harder and ground closer and paid less!

He would carry in his pocket a tract or a pamphlet which some one had loaned him, and whenever he had an idle moment during the day he would plod through a paragraph, and then think about it while he worked. Also he read the newspapers, and asked questions about them. One of the other porters at Hinds’s was a sharp little Irishman, who knew everything that Jurgis wanted to know; and while they were busy he would explain to him the geography of America, and its history, its constitution and its laws; also he gave him an idea of the business system of the country, the great railroads and corporations, and who owned them, and the labor unions, and the big strikes, and the men who had led them. Then at night, when he could get off, Jurgis would attend the Socialist meetings. During the campaign one was not dependent upon the street corner affairs, where the weather and the quality of the orator were equally uncertain; there were hall meetings every night, and one could hear speakers of national prominence.

He had written a veritable encyclopedia upon the subject, a book that was nearly as big as himself—And then there was a young author, who came from California, and had been a salmon fisher, an oyster-pirate, a longshoreman, a sailor; who had tramped the country and been sent to jail, had lived in the Whitechapel slums, and been to the Klondike in search of gold. All these things he pictured in his books, and because he was a man of genius he forced the world to hear him. Now he was famous, but wherever he went he still preached the gospel of the poor. And then there was one who was known at the “millionaire Socialist.” He had made a fortune in business, and spent nearly all of it in building up a magazine, which the post office department had tried to suppress, and had driven to Canada. He was a quiet-mannered man, whom you would have taken for anything in the world but a Socialist agitator. His speech was simple and informal—he could not understand why any one should get excited about these things. It was a process of economic evolution, he said, and he exhibited its laws and methods. Life was a struggle for existence, and the strong overcame the weak, and in turn were overcome by the strongest. Those who lost in the struggle were generally exterminated; but now and then they had been known to save themselves by combination—which was a new and higher kind of strength. It was so that the gregarious animals had overcome the predaceous; it was so, in human history, that the people had mastered the kings. The workers were simply the citizens of industry, and the Socialist movement was the expression of their will to survive. The inevitability of the revolution depended upon this fact, that they had no choice but to unite or be exterminated; this fact, grim and inexorable, depended upon no human will, it was the law of the economic process, of which the editor showed the details with the most marvelous precision.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002936\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002936\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002937\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002937\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And later on came the evening of the great meeting of the campaign, when Jurgis heard the two standard-bearers of his party.

The president of the union came out of his cell a ruined man; but also he came out a Socialist; and now for just ten years he had been traveling up and down the country, standing face to face with the people, and pleading with them for justice. He was a man of electric presence, tall and gaunt, with a face worn thin by struggle and suffering. The fury of outraged manhood gleamed in it—and the tears of suffering little children pleaded in his voice. When he spoke he paced the stage, lithe and eager, like a panther. He leaned over, reaching out for his audience; he pointed into their souls with an insistent finger. His voice was husky from much speaking, but the great auditorium was as still as death, and every one heard him.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002938\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002938\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002939\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002939\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then, as Jurgis came out from this meeting, some one handed him a paper which he carried home with him and read; and so he became acquainted with the “Appeal to Reason.” About twelve years previously a Colorado real-estate speculator had made up his mind that it was wrong to gamble in the necessities of life of human beings: and so he had retired and begun the publication of a Socialist weekly.

It had a manner all its own—it was full of ginger and spice, of Western slang and hustle: It collected news of the doings of the “plutes,” and served it up for the benefit of the “American working-mule.” It would have columns of the deadly parallel—the million dollars’ worth of diamonds, or the fancy pet-poodle establishment of a society dame, beside the fate of Mrs. Murphy of San Francisco, who had starved to death on the streets, or of John Robinson, just out of the hospital, who had hanged himself in New York because he could not find work. It collected the stories of graft and misery from the daily press, and made a little pungent paragraphs out of them. “Three banks of Bungtown, South Dakota, failed, and more savings of the workers swallowed up!” “The mayor of Sandy Creek, Oklahoma, has skipped with a hundred thousand dollars. That’s the kind of rulers the old partyites give you!” “The president of the Florida Flying Machine Company is in jail for bigamy. He was a prominent opponent of Socialism, which he said would break up the home!” The “Appeal” had what it called its “Army,” about thirty thousand of the faithful, who did things for it; and it was always exhorting the “Army” to keep its dander up, and occasionally encouraging it with a prize competition, for anything from a gold watch to a private yacht or an eighty-acre farm. Its office helpers were all known to the “Army” by quaint titles—“Inky Ike,” “the Bald-headed Man,” “the Redheaded Girl,” “the Bulldog,” “the Office Goat,” and “the One Hoss.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002942\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002942\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002943\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002943\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But sometimes, again, the “Appeal” would be desperately serious.

In a certain city of the country it had over forty of its “Army” in the headquarters of the Telegraph Trust, and no message of importance to Socialists ever went through that a copy of it did not go to the “Appeal.” It would print great broadsides during the campaign; one copy that came to Jurgis was a manifesto addressed to striking workingmen, of which nearly a million copies had been distributed in the industrial centers, wherever the employers’ associations had been carrying out their “open shop” program. “You have lost the strike!” it was headed. “And now what are you going to do about it?” It was what is called an “incendiary” appeal—it was written by a man into whose soul the iron had entered. When this edition appeared, twenty thousand copies were sent to the stockyards district; and they were taken out and stowed away in the rear of a little cigar store, and every evening, and on Sundays, the members of the Packingtown locals would get armfuls and distribute them on the streets and in the houses. The people of Packingtown had lost their strike, if ever a people had, and so they read these papers gladly, and twenty thousand were hardly enough to go round. Jurgis had resolved not to go near his old home again, but when he heard of this it was too much for him, and every night for a week he would get on the car and ride out to the stockyards, and help to undo his work of the previous year, when he had sent Mike Scully’s ten-pin setter to the city Board of Aldermen.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002944\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002944\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002945\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002945\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was quite marvelous to see what a difference twelve months had made in Packingtown—the eyes of the people were getting opened! The Socialists were literally sweeping everything before them that election, and Scully and the Cook County machine were at their wits’ end for an “issue.” At the very close of the campaign they bethought themselves of the fact that the strike had been broken by Negroes, and so they sent for a South Carolina fire-eater, the “pitchfork senator,” as he was called, a man who took off his coat when he talked to workingmen, and damned and swore like a Hessian. This meeting they advertised extensively, and the Socialists advertised it too—with the result that about a thousand of them were on hand that evening. The “pitchfork senator” stood their fusillade of questions for about an hour, and then went home in disgust, and the balance of the meeting was a strictly party affair. Jurgis, who had insisted upon coming, had the time of his life that night; he danced about and waved his arms in his excitement—and at the very climax he broke loose from his friends, and got out into the aisle, and proceeded to make a speech himself!

He understood human institutions, and blew them about like soap bubbles. It was surprising that so much destructiveness could be contained in one human mind. Was it government? The purpose of government was the guarding of property-rights, the perpetuation of ancient force and modern fraud. Or was it marriage? Marriage and prostitution were two sides of one shield, the predatory man’s exploitation of the sex-pleasure. The difference between them was a difference of class. If a woman had money she might dictate her own terms: equality, a life contract, and the legitimacy—that is, the property-rights—of her children. If she had no money, she was a proletarian, and sold herself for an existence. And then the subject became Religion, which was the Archfiend’s deadliest weapon. Government oppressed the body of the wage-slave, but Religion oppressed his mind, and poisoned the stream of progress at its source. The working-man was to fix his hopes upon a future life, while his pockets were picked in this one; he was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience—in short to all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism. The destiny of civilization would be decided in one final death struggle between the Red International and the Black, between Socialism and the Roman Catholic Church; while here at home, “the stygian midnight of American evangelicalism—”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002973\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002973\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002974\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002974\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And here the ex-preacher entered the field, and there was a lively tussle. “Comrade” Lucas was not what is called an educated man; he knew only the Bible, but it was the Bible interpreted by real experience.

But now Mr. Maynard, the editor, took occasion to remark, somewhat naïvely, that he had always understood that Socialists had a cut-and-dried program for the future of civilization; whereas here were two active members of the party, who, from what he could make out, were agreed about nothing at all. Would the two, for his enlightenment, try to ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the same party? This resulted, after much debating, in the formulating of two carefully worded propositions: First, that a Socialist believes in the common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing the necessities of life; and, second, that a Socialist believes that the means by which this is to be brought about is the class conscious political organization of the wage-earners. Thus far they were at one; but no farther. To Lucas, the religious zealot, the co-operative commonwealth was the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of Heaven, which is “within you.” To the other, Socialism was simply a necessary step toward a far-distant goal, a step to be tolerated with impatience. Schliemann called himself a “philosophic anarchist”; and he explained that an anarchist was one who believed that the end of human existence was the free development of every personality, unrestricted by laws save those of its own being. Since the same kind of match would light every one’s fire and the same-shaped loaf of bread would fill every one’s stomach, it would be perfectly feasible to submit industry to the control of a majority vote. There was only one earth, and the quantity of material things was limited. Of intellectual and moral things, on the other hand, there was no limit, and one could have more without another’s having less; hence “Communism in material production, anarchism in intellectual,” was the formula of modern proletarian thought. As soon as the birth agony was over, and the wounds of society had been healed, there would be established a simple system whereby each man was credited with his labor and debited with his purchases; and after that the processes of production, exchange, and consumption would go on automatically, and without our being conscious of them, any more than a man is conscious of the beating of his heart. And then, explained Schliemann, society would break up into independent, self-governing communities of mutually congenial persons; examples of which at present were clubs, churches, and political parties. After the revolution, all the intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of men would be cared for by such “free associations”; romantic novelists would be supported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and impressionist painters would be supported by those who liked to look at impressionist pictures—and the same with preachers and scientists, editors and actors and musicians. If any one wanted to work or paint or pray, and could find no one to maintain him, he could support himself by working part of the time. That was the case at present, the only difference being that the competitive wage system compelled a man to work all the time to live, while, after the abolition of privilege and exploitation, any one would be able to support himself by an hour’s work a day. Also the artist’s audience of the present was a small minority of people, all debased and vulgarized by the effort it had cost them to win in the commercial battle, of the intellectual and artistic activities which would result when the whole of mankind was set free from the nightmare of competition, we could at present form no conception whatever.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002993\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002993\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002994\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002994\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr. Schliemann asserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an hour’s toil by each of its members. “Just what,” answered the other, “would be the productive capacity of society if the present resources of science were utilized, we have no means of ascertaining; but we may be sure it would exceed anything that would sound reasonable to minds inured to the ferocious barbarities of capitalism. After the triumph of the international proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable; and who can figure the cost of war to humanity—not merely the value of the lives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of keeping millions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for battle and parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by the war attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the drunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial impotence and the moral deadness?

So we have, at the present moment, a society with, say, thirty per cent of the population occupied in producing useless articles, and one per cent occupied in destroying them. And this is not all; for the servants and panders of the parasites are also parasites, the milliners and the jewelers and the lackeys have also to be supported by the useful members of the community. And bear in mind also that this monstrous disease affects not merely the idlers and their menials, its poison penetrates the whole social body. Beneath the hundred thousand women of the elite are a million middle-class women, miserable because they are not of the elite, and trying to appear of it in public; and beneath them, in turn, are five million farmers’ wives reading ‘fashion papers’ and trimming bonnets, and shop-girls and serving-maids selling themselves into brothels for cheap jewelry and imitation seal-skin robes. And then consider that, added to this competition in display, you have, like oil on the flames, a whole system of competition in selling! You have manufacturers contriving tens of thousands of catchpenny devices, storekeepers displaying them, and newspapers and magazines filled up with advertisements of them!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002997\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002997\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002998\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002998\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“And don’t forget the wastes of fraud,” put in young Fisher.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002999\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000002999\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003000\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003000\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“When one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,” responded Schliemann—“the science of persuading people to buy what they do not want—he is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house of capitalist destructiveness, and he scarcely knows which of a dozen horrors to point out first.

Since a man has intellectual needs also, he will work longer, earn more, and provide for them to his own taste and in his own way. I live on the same earth as the majority, I wear the same kind of shoes and sleep in the same kind of bed; but I do not think the same kind of thoughts, and I do not wish to pay for such thinkers as the majority selects. I wish such things to be left to free effort, as at present. If people want to listen to a certain preacher, they get together and contribute what they please, and pay for a church and support the preacher, and then listen to him; I, who do not want to listen to him, stay away, and it costs me nothing. In the same way there are magazines about Egyptian coins, and Catholic saints, and flying machines, and athletic records, and I know nothing about any of them. On the other hand, if wage slavery were abolished, and I could earn some spare money without paying tribute to an exploiting capitalist, then there would be a magazine for the purpose of interpreting and popularizing the gospel of Friedrich Nietzsche, the prophet of Evolution, and also of Horace Fletcher, the inventor of the noble science of clean eating; and incidentally, perhaps, for the discouraging of long skirts, and the scientific breeding of men and women, and the establishing of divorce by mutual consent.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003023\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003023\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003024\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003024\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Dr. Schliemann paused for a moment. “That was a lecture,” he said with a laugh, “and yet I am only begun!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003025\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003025\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003026\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003026\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“What else is there?” asked Maynard.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003027\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003027\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003028\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003028\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“I have pointed out some of the negative wastes of competition,” answered the other. “I have hardly mentioned the positive economies of co-operation. Allowing five to a family, there are fifteen million families in this country; and at least ten million of these live separately, the domestic drudge being either the wife or a wage slave. Now set aside the modern system of pneumatic house-cleaning, and the economies of co-operative cooking; and consider one single item, the washing of dishes. Surely it is moderate to say that the dish-washing for a family of five takes half an hour a day; with ten hours as a day’s work, it takes, therefore, half a million able-bodied persons—mostly women to do the dish-washing of the country. And note that this is most filthy and deadening and brutalizing work; that it is a cause of anemia, nervousness, ugliness, and ill-temper; of prostitution, suicide, and insanity; of drunken husbands and degenerate children—for all of which things the community has naturally to pay. And now consider that in each of my little free communities there would be a machine which would wash and dry the dishes, and do it, not merely to the eye and the touch, but scientifically—sterilizing them—and do it at a saving of all the drudgery and nine-tenths of the time! All of these things you may find in the books of Mrs. Gilman; and then take Kropotkin’s Fields, Factories, and Workshops, and read about the new science of agriculture, which has been built up in the last ten years; by which, with made soils and intensive culture, a gardener can raise ten or twelve crops in a season, and two hundred tons of vegetables upon a single acre; by which the population of the whole globe could be supported on the soil now cultivated in the United States alone! It is impossible to apply such methods now, owing to the ignorance and poverty of our scattered farming population; but imagine the problem of providing the food supply of our nation once taken in hand systematically and rationally, by scientists! All the poor and rocky land set apart for a national timber reserve, in which our children play, and our young men hunt, and our poets dwell! The most favorable climate and soil for each product selected; the exact requirements of the community known, and the acreage figured accordingly; the most improved machinery employed, under the direction of expert agricultural chemists! I was brought up on a farm, and I know the awful deadliness of farm work; and I like to picture it all as it will be after the revolution. To picture the great potato-planting machine, drawn by four horses, or an electric motor, ploughing the furrow, cutting and dropping and covering the potatoes, and planting a score of acres a day! To picture the great potato-digging machine, run by electricity, perhaps, and moving across a thousand-acre field, scooping up earth and potatoes, and dropping the latter into sacks! To every other kind of vegetable and fruit handled in the same way—apples and oranges picked by machinery, cows milked by electricity—things which are already done, as you may know. To picture the harvest fields of the future, to which millions of happy men and women come for a summer holiday, brought by special trains, the exactly needful number to each place! And to contrast all this with our present agonizing system of independent small farming,—a stunted, haggard, ignorant man, mated with a yellow, lean, and sad-eyed drudge, and toiling from four o’clock in the morning until nine at night, working the children as soon as they are able to walk, scratching the soil with its primitive tools, and shut out from all knowledge and hope, from all their benefits of science and invention, and all the joys of the spirit—held to a bare existence by competition in labor, and boasting of his freedom because he is too blind to see his chains!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003029\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003029\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003030\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003030\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Dr. Schliemann paused a moment. “And then,” he continued, “place beside this fact of an unlimited food supply, the newest discovery of physiologists, that most of the ills of the human system are due to overfeeding!

But just as soon as labor is set free, then the price of such work will begin to rise. So one by one the old, dingy, and unsanitary factories will come down—it will be cheaper to build new; and so the steamships will be provided with stoking machinery, and so the dangerous trades will be made safe, or substitutes will be found for their products. In exactly the same way, as the citizens of our Industrial Republic become refined, year by year the cost of slaughterhouse products will increase; until eventually those who want to eat meat will have to do their own killing—and how long do you think the custom would survive then?—To go on to another item—one of the necessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political corruption; and one of the consequences of civic administration by ignorant and vicious politicians, is that preventable diseases kill off half our population. And even if science were allowed to try, it could do little, because the majority of human beings are not yet human beings at all, but simply machines for the creating of wealth for others. They are penned up in filthy houses and left to rot and stew in misery, and the conditions of their life make them ill faster than all the doctors in the world could heal them; and so, of course, they remain as centers of contagion, poisoning the lives of all of us, and making happiness impossible for even the most selfish.

Later on in the evening, when the group broke up, he heard Mrs. Fisher say to her, in a low voice, “I wonder if Mr. Maynard will still write the same things about Socialism”; to which she answered, “I don’t know—but if he does we shall know that he is a knave!”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003037\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003037\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003038\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003038\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And only a few hours after this came election day—when the long campaign was over, and the whole country seemed to stand still and hold its breath, awaiting the issue.

When the final accounts were made up, the Socialist vote proved to be over four hundred thousand—an increase of something like three hundred and fifty per cent in four years. And that was doing well; but the party was dependent for its early returns upon messages from the locals, and naturally those locals which had been most successful were the ones which felt most like reporting; and so that night every one in the hall believed that the vote was going to be six, or seven, or even eight hundred thousand. Just such an incredible increase had actually been made in Chicago, and in the state; the vote of the city had been 6,700 in 1900, and now it was 47,000; that of Illinois had been 9,600, and now it was 69,000! So, as the evening waxed, and the crowd piled in, the meeting was a sight to be seen. Bulletins would be read, and the people would shout themselves hoarse—and then some one would make a speech, and there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and more bulletins. There would come messages from the secretaries of neighboring states, reporting their achievements; the vote of Indiana had gone from 2,300 to 12,000, of Wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of Ohio from 4,800 to 36,000! There were telegrams to the national office from enthusiastic individuals in little towns which had made amazing and unprecedented increases in a single year: Benedict, Kansas, from 26 to 260; Henderson, Kentucky, from 19 to 111; Holland, Michigan, from 14 to 208; Cleo, Oklahoma, from 0 to 104; Martin’s Ferry, Ohio, from 0 to 296—and many more of the same kind. There were literally hundreds of such towns; there would be reports from half a dozen of them in a single batch of telegrams. And the men who read the despatches off to the audience were old campaigners, who had been to the places and helped to make the vote, and could make appropriate comments: Quincy, Illinois, from 189 to 831—that was where the mayor had arrested a Socialist speaker! Crawford County, Kansas, from 285 to 1,975; that was the home of the “Appeal to Reason”! Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261 to 10,184; that was the answer of labor to the Citizens’ Alliance Movement!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003041\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003041\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003042\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/2648a2d0ac01f9ae/text/000003042\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-961711 twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-c675eb twpub-2648a2d0ac01f9ae-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then there were official returns from the various precincts and wards of the city itself! Whether it was a factory district or one of the “silk-stocking” wards seemed to make no particular difference in the increase; but one of the things which surprised the party leaders most was the tremendous vote that came rolling in from the stockyards. Packingtown comprised three wards of the city, and the vote in the spring of 1903 had been 500, and in the fall of the same year, 1,600. Now, only one year later, it was over 6,300—and the Democratic vote only 8,800! There were other wards in which the Democratic vote had been actually surpassed, and in two districts, members of the state legislature had been elected.

The orator had been the head of the city’s relief bureau in the stockyards, until the sight of misery and corruption had made him sick. He was young, hungry-looking, full of fire; and as he swung his long arms and beat up the crowd, to Jurgis he seemed the very spirit of the revolution. “Organize! Organize! Organize!”—that was his cry. He was afraid of this tremendous vote, which his party had not expected, and which it had not earned. “These men are not Socialists!” he cried. “This election will pass, and the excitement will die, and people will forget about it; and if you forget about it, too, if you sink back and rest upon your oars, we shall lose this vote that we have polled to-day, and our enemies will laugh us to scorn! It rests with you to take your resolution—now, in the flush of victory, to find these men who have voted for us, and bring them to our meetings, and organize them and bind them to us! We shall not find all our campaigns as easy as this one. Everywhere in the country tonight the old party politicians are studying this vote, and setting their sails by it; and nowhere will they be quicker or more cunning than here in our own city. Fifty thousand Socialist votes in Chicago means a municipal-ownership Democracy in the spring! And then they will fool the voters once more, and all the powers of plunder and corruption will be swept into office again! But whatever they may do when they get in, there is one thing they will not do, and that will be the thing for which they were elected! They will not give the people of our city municipal ownership—they will not mean to do it, they will not try to do it; all that they will do is give our party in Chicago the greatest opportunity that has ever come to Socialism in America! We shall have the sham reformers self-stultified and self-convicted; we shall have the radical Democracy left without a lie with which to cover its nakedness! And then will begin the rush that will never be checked, the tide that will never turn till it has reached its flood—that will be irresistible, overwhelming—the rallying of the outraged workingmen of Chicago to our standard! And we shall organize them, we shall drill them, we shall marshal them for the victory! We shall bear down the opposition, we shall sweep if before us—and <i>Chicago will be ours!</i> Chicago will be ours!
