The downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year Machiavelli entered the public service. During his official career Florence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted until 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his office. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they were once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli’s literary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few weeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his fifty-eighth year, without having regained office.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000026\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000026\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000027\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000027\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000028\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000028\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>YOUTH — Æt. 1-25—1469-94</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000029\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000029\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000030\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000030\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Although there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the Florence of those days is so well known that the early environment of this representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been described as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by the fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving Lorenzo. Savonarola’s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have been slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the fortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a gibe in <i>The Prince</i>, where he is cited as an example of an unarmed prophet who came to a bad end.

He writes: “They were freer than their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other kinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming, and women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with wit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly was thought the wisest.” In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli shows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and leads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes: “I have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure, especially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than which I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to me, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your share.” Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: “This will turn out well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then, you have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters and music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I have. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success and honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help you if you help yourself.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000033\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000033\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000034\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000034\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000035\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000035\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>OFFICE — Æt. 25-43—1494-1512</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000036\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000036\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000037\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000037\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The second period of Machiavelli’s life was spent in the service of the free Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the expulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512.

This result was attained in the battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won in eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during these events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out between the pope and the French, because friendship with France had dictated the entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II finally formed the Holy League against France, and with the assistance of the Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy of the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the Medici should be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st September 1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal for the dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end to his public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining office.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000052\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000052\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000053\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000053\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000054\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000054\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>LITERATURE AND DEATH — Æt. 43-58—1512-27</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000055\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000055\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000056\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000056\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>On the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had vainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence, was dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he was accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici, imprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope, Leo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at San Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In a letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left a very interesting description of his life at this period, which elucidates his methods and his motives in writing <i>The Prince</i>. After describing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he writes: “The evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at the entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt, and put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass into the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly received by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I do not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their actions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I feel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay, death does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.

To an Englishman of Shakespeare’s time the translation of such a treatise was in some ways a comparatively easy task, for in those times the genius of the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language; to the Englishman of to-day it is not so simple. To take a single example: the word <i>intrattenere</i>, employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy adopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would by an Elizabethan be correctly rendered “entertain,” and every contemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that “Rome <i>entertained</i> the Ætolians and the Achaeans without augmenting their power.” But to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and ambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that “<i>Rome maintained friendly relations with the Ætolians</i>,” etc., using four words to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity of the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to the sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that the reader, in his eagerness to reach the author’s meaning, may overlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000088\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000088\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000089\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000089\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"p2\\\">The following is a list of the works of Machiavelli:</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000090\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000090\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000091\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000091\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Principal works.

He who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000153\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000153\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000154\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000154\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000155\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000155\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000156\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000156\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt.

The Romans were brought into Greece by the Ætolians; and in every other country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants.

Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and Ætolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and Ætolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends without first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:—Let us enjoy the benefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000161\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000161\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000162\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000162\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000160\\\">[2]</$link> See remark in the introduction on the word “intrattenere.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000163\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000163\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000164\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000164\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned.

And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into Italy.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000173\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000173\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000174\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000174\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and deprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples, divided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000175\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000175\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000176\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000176\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame.

The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000196\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000196\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000197\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000197\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom, for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change.

Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no other state, is compelled to reside there in person.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000220\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000220\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000221\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000221\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune, have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and such like are the most excellent examples.

The difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security.

This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.

Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position; because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having always lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000239\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000239\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000240\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000240\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>States that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000242\\\"><sup>[1]</sup></$link> fixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps, and that those foundations, which others have laid <i>before</i> they became princes, they must lay <i>afterwards</i>.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000241\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000241\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000242\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000242\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000240\\\">[1]</$link> “Le radici e corrispondenze,” their roots (i.e. foundations) and correspondencies or relations with other states—a common meaning of “correspondence” and “correspondency” in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000243\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000243\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000244\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000244\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and these are Francesco Sforza<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000246\\\"><sup>[2]</sup></$link> and Cesare Borgia.

Firstly, he did not see his way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the Church; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke of Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini were already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he saw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been assisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope, namely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved him, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers, so as to make himself securely master of part of their states. This was easy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other reasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not only not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy with the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He was no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the king. The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was hindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him, that not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the same. Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. And as to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the Duchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000251\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000251\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000252\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000252\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them, called a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the rebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless dangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the French. Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor Pagolo—whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses—the Orsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power at Sinigalia.<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000254\\\"><sup>[3]</sup></$link> Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good foundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of Urbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he gained them all over to himself.

And because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the people, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if any cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in the natural sternness of the minister.

But as to the future he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to himself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope with their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the college more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before the Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first shock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his protection. And as he had no longer to study France (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his own power and ability.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000263\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000263\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000264\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000264\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword.

This man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding for this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion. And although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not only was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000282\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000282\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000283\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000283\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000281\\\">[1]</$link> Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000284\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000284\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000285\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000285\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any one, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers.

After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo, and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body and mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many years, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look upon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also to that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000288\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000288\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000289\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000289\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Giovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew, and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him. No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was stated above.

Those about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. To restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time to ruin the Orsini.

Such things Julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among the barons.

And if the Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000371\\\"><sup>[4]</sup></$link> and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while ago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest renown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned to enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they forsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy.

From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After these came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to lower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own. They did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom. They did not attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night; they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their military rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both fatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000382\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000382\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000383\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000383\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000381\\\">[8]</$link> Alberigo da Conio.

Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they can now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot stand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come off well against others. The armies of the French have thus become mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much inferior to one’s own forces. And this example proves it, for the kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had been enlarged or maintained.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000409\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000409\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000410\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000410\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000408\\\">[3]</$link> Charles VII of France, surnamed “The Victorious,” born 1403, died 1461.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000411\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000411\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000412\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000412\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000408\\\">[4]</$link> Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000413\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000413\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000414\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000414\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have said above of hectic fevers.

And, on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to guard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other suspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000424\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000424\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000425\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000425\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of localities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of rivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care.

Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know that every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need not make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like virtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000439\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000439\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000440\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000440\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000441\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000441\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br>\\nCONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000442\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000442\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000443\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000443\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Commencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say that it would be well to be reputed liberal.

This arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most excellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man, against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more license than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the control of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed itself, but contributed to his glory.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000473\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000473\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000474\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000474\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000475\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000475\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000476\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000476\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000477\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000477\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000479\\\"><sup>[1]</sup></$link><br>\\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000478\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000478\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000479\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000479\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000477\\\">[1]</$link> “The present chapter has given greater offence than any other portion of Machiavelli’s writings.” Burd, “Il Principe,” p. 297.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000480\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000480\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000481\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000481\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000483\\\"><sup>[2]</sup></$link> the one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000482\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000482\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000483\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000483\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000481\\\">[2]</$link> “Contesting,” <i>i.e</i>. “striving for mastery.” Mr Burd points out that this passage is imitated directly from Cicero’s “De Officiis”: “Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum est ad posterius, si uti non licet superiore.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000484\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000484\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000485\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000485\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived.

Hence it arose that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000531\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000531\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000532\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000532\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>From these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died honoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title, and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards, being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor despised.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000533\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000533\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000534\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000534\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers, who, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus, having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his administration.

And as he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true. But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in France, and took from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived against him for his violence.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000541\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000541\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000542\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000542\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single murders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state. Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and proved the emperor’s ruin.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000543\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000543\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000544\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000544\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000545\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000545\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000546\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000546\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus.

There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be handled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they quite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter, considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and service should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character already shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has always distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a prince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000560\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000560\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000561\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000561\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use; rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue, therefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be permitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the more easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if war comes this policy proves fallacious.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000562\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000562\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000563\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000563\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher, as by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many consider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000564\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000564\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000565\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000565\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by others. But on this question one cannot speak generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say this, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been hostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support themselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect his affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then he will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government, and are therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it, were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000566\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000566\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000567\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000567\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been made use of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in our times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello so that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia, razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and considered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses, therefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you good in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. The castle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this reason the best possible fortress is—not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you. It has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000569\\\"><sup>[1]</sup></$link> when the Count Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to withstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that time that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore, it would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. All these things considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000568\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000568\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000569\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000569\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000567\\\">[1]</$link> Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and Lucrezia Landriani, born 1463, died 1509.

In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him. Further, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater schemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable example, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa, he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them.

But when it cannot be avoided, as happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to attack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince ought to favour one of the parties.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000583\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000583\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000584\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000584\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones, because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to take the lesser evil.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000585\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000585\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000586\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000586\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour the proficient in every art.

Florio: “Arte . . . a whole company of any trade in any city or corporation town.” The guilds of Florence are most admirably described by Mr Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject (Methuen, 1906). Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called “artel,” exist in Russia to-day, <i>cf</i>. Sir Mackenzie Wallace’s “Russia,” ed. 1905: “The sons . . . were always during the working season members of an artel. In some of the larger towns there are artels of a much more complex kind— permanent associations, possessing large capital, and pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual members.” The word “artel,” despite its apparent similarity, has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with “ars” or “arte.” Its root is that of the verb “rotisya,” to bind oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only another form of “rota,” which now signifies a “regimental company.” In both words the underlying idea is that of a body of men united by an oath. “Tribu” were possibly gentile groups, united by common descent, and included individuals connected by marriage. Perhaps our words “sects” or “clans” would be most appropriate.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000591\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000591\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000592\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000592\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000593\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000593\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br>\\nCONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000594\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000594\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000595\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000595\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince.

I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times.

Consider his first enterprise against Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he drew after him the King of France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. Therefore Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome until he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded. Because the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the others would have raised a thousand fears.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000647\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000647\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000648\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000648\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000649\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000649\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000650\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000650\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out.

Hence it is that for so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.<$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000671\\\"><sup>[2]</sup></$link></p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000670\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000670\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000671\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000671\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"footnote\\\"><a></a> <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000669\\\">[2]</$link> The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua, 1501; Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000672\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000672\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000673\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000673\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>If, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own forces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better soldiers.

For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been over with them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old.

dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them, who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate who these persons may have been because they are well known to everybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to those who read them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished in his birth, as the course of this history will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000732\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000732\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000733\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000733\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a son Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard something resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and partly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When he heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no children, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for it, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio was quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left off reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms, delighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000734\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000734\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000735\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000735\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family, named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches, bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the top of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street in those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far excelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer Francesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he stood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer Francesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable, nothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and in a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000736\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000736\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000737\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000737\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and tournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what enhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to others, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his equals, and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces. Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all Lombardy.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000738\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000738\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000739\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000739\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many friends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary for that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son thirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to be his son’s tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died Francesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that goodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to the son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father. Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and have him driven out of Lucca.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000740\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000740\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000741\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000741\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo, who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca, with whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting their restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon with Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The governor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those who fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000742\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000742\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000743\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000743\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain had lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the camp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were separated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio’s men were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy’s troops, and the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks. So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the first onset.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000744\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000744\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000745\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000745\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming to the knowledge of Uguccione, who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him a proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his son Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take Castruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio, fearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should close their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked Uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away with his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000746\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000746\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000747\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000747\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca, and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people that they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed a fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained at that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a short time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the pass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and wrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected prince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at the head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the people’s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was appointed the emperor’s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to accept him as their lord.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000748\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000748\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000749\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000749\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country, if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces of his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he divided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the King Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000750\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000750\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000751\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000751\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not received such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They found their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him. They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater intelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the news of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in command of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home. Contrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to him, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf, for he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to pardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their former friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to their house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged Stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace, as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to leave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce, which they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the state.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000752\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000752\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000753\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000753\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he could get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends with the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them many promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to the city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and quickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great valour.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000754\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000754\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000755\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000755\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. The German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened—murders and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble. When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its front: “I am what God wills.” Whilst on the back was: “What God desires shall be.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000756\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000756\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000757\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000757\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out some of Castruccio’s officials and partisans, and killing others, they restored the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard where the Florentines’ lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He believed that if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either—neither of them wishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations to no one. For these reasons, and also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and there was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force before they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this trouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put to death.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000758\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000758\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000759\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000759\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle. The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the castle. Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own, although some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting reached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were unable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the narrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were engaged with the enemy’s infantry were scattered or killed without having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried out with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack, but gave way, and were soon in full retreat—conquered more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all Florentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not content with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both sides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola, about two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the spoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding horse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to corrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city gates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the participators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and he sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000760\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000760\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000761\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000761\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the pressure of Castruccio’s army, owing to his being compelled to leave his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi, one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of Castruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few are not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio. This betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering their banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and energy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines their opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo, the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid every Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to march on the latter—a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000762\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000762\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000763\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000763\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army which the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to think that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the Pisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and Gusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they divided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the direction of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack Castruccio’s forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they would find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his own command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to take this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide expanse of land between them and the river.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000764\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000764\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000765\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000765\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and, having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet the water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the saddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the Arno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more difficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not move. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and trampled each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and one part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This cleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and thus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these tired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio’s reserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any decisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his inferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that when he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with lance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio’s army. But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines were so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000766\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000766\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000767\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000767\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the watch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day; he being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with high fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and addressed him as follows:</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000768\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000768\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000769\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000769\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the midst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils, because I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and Pisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the Florentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these peoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least more peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but one more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who insists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me with sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time to surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have never concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a boy—a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should feel—and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been born of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and capable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been witness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all his possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love, and increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And in order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect my mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father. Thus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure. Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented under thy government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are of nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under a Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs recently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring thee advantages and security. It is of the greatest important in this world that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own strength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000770\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000770\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000771\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000771\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he died.

His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried in San Francesco at Lucca.

Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca.

In stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory that brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not angered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had said: “You would not have given more than a penny.” “That is true,” answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: “A ducat is much less to me.” Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: “Fisherman are willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they may take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may catch a whale”; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: “If that be a vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.” Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him: “Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest into such places.” A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: “Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.” Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher: “You are like the dogs who always run after those who will give them the best to eat,” and was answered: “We are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest need of them.” Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: “When thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon another.” To a person who was boasting that he had read many things, Castruccio said: “He knows better than to boast of remembering many things.” Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied: “An ox does the same.” Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: “She has not taken me in, I have taken her.” Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered: “Thou dost not spend as much as I do?” and being told that it was true, he continued: “Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.” Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: “I knew not where to spit in order to offend thee less.” Being asked how Caesar died he said: “God willing I will die as he did.” Being one night in the house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was usual in one of his station, so he said: “He who is considered wise by day will not be considered a fool at night.” A person came to demand a favour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea threw himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by Castruccio, said: “Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast thy ears in thy feet,” whereupon he obtained double the favour he had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous words, he said to him: “When you have another request to make, send someone else to make it.” Having been wearied by a similar man with a long oration who wound up by saying: “Perhaps I have fatigued you by speaking so long,” Castruccio said: “You have not, because I have not listened to a word you said.” He used to say of one who had been a beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he said: “Do you laugh because you are successful or because another is unfortunate?” Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: “What shall I give you if you will let me give you a blow on the nose?” Castruccio answered: “A helmet.” Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying that they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused when the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise that whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with only looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to be buried when he died, and answered: “With the face turned downwards, for I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.” On being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat to preserve his health, and replied: “If the man be rich let him eat when he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.” Seeing one of his gentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: “I pray God that you will let him feed you also.” Seeing that someone had written upon his house in Latin the words: “May God preserve this house from the wicked,” he said, “The owner must never go in.” Passing through one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door, and remarked: “That house will fly through the door.” He was having a discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them, and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. “Is this king of yours a bad man or a good one?” asked Castruccio, and was told that he was a good one, whereupon he said, “Why should you suggest that I should be afraid of a good man?”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000774\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000774\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000775\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000775\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his high qualities.

As in his life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his age as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had Fortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia or Rome.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000776\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000776\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000777\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000777\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c7\\\">*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PRINCE ***</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000778\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000778\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c8\\\">This file should be named 1232-h.htm or 1232-h.zip</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000779\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000779\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c8\\\">This and all associated files of various formats will be found in https://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/3/1232/</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000780\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000780\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c2\\\">Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000781\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/ac6d9189e2f126ac/text/000000781\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-b60bd1 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-d86123 twpub-ac6d9189e2f126ac-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c2\\\">Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
