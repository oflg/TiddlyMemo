Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000076\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000076\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000077\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000077\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000078\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000078\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000079\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000079\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me.

One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform.

He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. “I have to use this room as a place of business,” he said, “and these people are my clients.” Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me.

It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a “To Let” card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000233\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000233\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.

At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture.

After Holmes’ departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland.

But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself.

He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson.

They were afterwards seen together upon the platform.

How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson.

He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly with him. “You are of age,” he said, “and there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess.” Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. “I don’t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,” he said. “I will just go after him and see what he does with himself.” With those words he took his hat and started off down the street.

They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning.”</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000520\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000520\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>“They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,” remarked Holmes.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000521\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000521\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>“So it proved.

Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for.

The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose.

Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000616\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000616\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles.

In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000651\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000651\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa.

The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier’s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father’s mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000654\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000654\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman.

In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000656\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000656\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000657\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000657\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>“You’re not hurt, I hope, miss,” said her preserver, respectfully.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000658\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000658\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. “I’m awful frightened,” she said, naively; “whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?”</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000659\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000659\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>“Thank God you kept your seat,” the other said earnestly.

So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them.

On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn—for so it is called—was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000794\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000794\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank.

In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000795\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000795\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them.

It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence—a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000797\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000797\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000798\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000798\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"pgmonospaced\\\">                        JOHN FERRIER,\\n<br>                 FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, <$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000947\\\">22</$link>                    Died August 4th, 1860.\\n<br></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000799\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000799\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph.

Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. “She shall not be buried in that,” he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone.

Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson’s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000816\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000816\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it.

Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor.

With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber’s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000819\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000819\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him to continue the pursuit.

At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth.

I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000895\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000895\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-d25ff5 twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-9d49af twpub-07ccf0f1b5679263-6b4cd0\\\"><p>“On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man’s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man’s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea.

Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman.

I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet.

FULL LICENSE ***\\n<br>\\n<br>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE\\n<br>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK\\n<br>\\n<br>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free\\n<br>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work\\n<br>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project\\n<br>Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at\\n<br>http://gutenberg.org/license).\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic works\\n<br>\\n<br>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to\\n<br>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property\\n<br>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all\\n<br>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy\\n<br>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.\\n<br>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the\\n<br>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or\\n<br>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.B.  “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark.  It may only be\\n<br>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who\\n<br>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few\\n<br>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n<br>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See\\n<br>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement\\n<br>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\n<br>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation”\\n<br> or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the\\n<br>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an\\n<br>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are\\n<br>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from\\n<br>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative\\n<br>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg\\n<br>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by\\n<br>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of\\n<br>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with\\n<br>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by\\n<br>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\\n<br>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in\\n<br>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check\\n<br>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement\\n<br>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or\\n<br>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning\\n<br>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United\\n<br>States.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate\\n<br>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently\\n<br>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the\\n<br>phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project\\n<br>Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,\\n<br>copied or distributed:\\n<br>\\n<br>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\\n<br>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or\\n<br>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\\n<br>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived\\n<br>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is\\n<br>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied\\n<br>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees\\n<br>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work\\n<br>with the phrase “Project Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the\\n<br>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1\\n<br>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or\\n<br>1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted\\n<br>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution\\n<br>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional\\n<br>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked\\n<br>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the\\n<br>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this\\n<br>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this\\n<br>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without\\n<br>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with\\n<br>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,\\n<br>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any\\n<br>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or\\n<br>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than\\n<br>“Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version\\n<br>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),\\n<br>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a\\n<br>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon\\n<br>request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other\\n<br>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,\\n<br>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works\\n<br>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing\\n<br>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided\\n<br>that\\n<br>\\n<br>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from\\n<br>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method\\n<br>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is\\n<br>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he\\n<br>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the\\n<br>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments\\n<br>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you\\n<br>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax\\n<br>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and\\n<br>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the\\n<br>     address specified in Section 4, “Information about donations to\\n<br>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.”\\n<br> \\n<br>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies\\n<br>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\\n<br>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>     License.  You must require such a user to return or\\n<br>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium\\n<br>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of\\n<br>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.\\n<br>\\n<br>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any\\n<br>     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the\\n<br>     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days\\n<br>     of receipt of the work.\\n<br>\\n<br>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free\\n<br>     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set\\n<br>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from\\n<br>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael\\n<br>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the\\n<br>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\\n<br>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\\n<br>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\n<br>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\\n<br>“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\\n<br>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\\n<br>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\\n<br>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\\n<br>your equipment.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right\\n<br>of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\n<br>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\n<br>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\\n<br>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\\n<br>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\\n<br>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\\n<br>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\\n<br>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\\n<br>DAMAGE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\\n<br>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\\n<br>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\\n<br>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\\n<br>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\\n<br>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\\n<br>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\\n<br>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\\n<br>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\\n<br>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\\n<br>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\\n<br>opportunities to fix the problem.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\\n<br>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’ WITH NO OTHER\\n<br>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\\n<br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\\n<br>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\\n<br>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\\n<br>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\\n<br>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\\n<br>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\\n<br>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\n<br>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\n<br>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\\n<br>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\\n<br>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\\n<br>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\\n<br>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\\n<br>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\n<br>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\n<br>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\n<br>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\n<br>people in all walks of life.\\n<br>\\n<br>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\n<br>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s\\n<br>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\n<br>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\n<br>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\n<br>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n<br>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\n<br>and the Foundation web page at

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\n<br>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\n<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\n<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\n<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n<br>\\n<br>     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\n<br>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\n<br>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\n<br>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/toc/np-1\": {\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/toc/np-1\",\n            \"caption\": \"A STUDY IN SCARLET.\",\n            \"tags\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/toc\",\n            \"target\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000003\",\n            \"list\": \"\",\n            \"role\": \"toc\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/toc/np-3\": {\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/toc/np-3\",\n            \"caption\": \"PART I.\",\n            \"tags\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/toc/np-2\",\n            \"target\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/text/000000070\",\n            \"list\": \"\",\n            \"role\": \"toc\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/toc/np-4\": {\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/07ccf0f1b5679263/toc/np-4\",\n            \"caption\": \"CHAPTER I.
