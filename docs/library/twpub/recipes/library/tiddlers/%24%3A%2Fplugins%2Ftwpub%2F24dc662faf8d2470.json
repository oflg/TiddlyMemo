Narrow,\\nintense, almost claustrophobic, the result is a book\\nabout extreme states of being, the collapse of men and\\nwomen who have lost their psychic bearings and now\\nhover, at best tolerated, at the edge of the little\\ncommunity in which they live.

This vision has its\\ntruth, and at its best it is a terrible if narrow\\ntruth—but it is itself also grotesque, with the tone\\nof the authorial voice and the mode of composition\\nforming muted signals of the book's content.

It became the critical fashion to see\\nAnderson's &quot;gropings&quot; as a sign of delayed adolescence,\\na failure to develop as a writer.

The very man who throws\\nsuch words as these knows in his heart that he is also\\nfacing a wall.&quot; This remark seems to me both dignified\\nand strong, yet it must be admitted that there was some\\njustice in the negative responses to his later work.\\nFor what characterized it was not so much &quot;groping&quot; as\\nthe imitation of &quot;groping,&quot; the self-caricature of a\\nwriter who feels driven back upon an earlier self that\\nis, alas, no longer available.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/24dc662faf8d2470/text/000000059\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/24dc662faf8d2470/text/000000059\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-24dc662faf8d2470-f09fcd twpub-24dc662faf8d2470-6b4cd0\\\"><p>But Winesburg, Ohio remains a vital work, fresh and\\nauthentic. Most of its stories are composed in a minor\\nkey, a tone of subdued pathos—pathos marking both the\\nnature and limit of Anderson's talent. (He spoke of\\nhimself as a &quot;minor writer.&quot;) In a few stories,\\nhowever, he was able to reach beyond pathos and to\\nstrike a tragic note. The single best story in\\nWinesburg, Ohio is, I think, &quot;The Untold Lie,&quot; in which\\nthe urgency of choice becomes an outer sign of a tragic\\nelement in the human condition. And in Anderson's\\nsingle greatest story, &quot;The Egg,&quot; which appeared a few\\nyears after Winesburg, Ohio, he succeeded in bringing\\ntogether a surface of farce with an undertone of\\ntragedy. &quot;The Egg&quot; is an American masterpiece.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/24dc662faf8d2470/text/000000060\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/24dc662faf8d2470/text/000000060\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-24dc662faf8d2470-f09fcd twpub-24dc662faf8d2470-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Anderson's influence upon later American writers,\\nespecially those who wrote short stories, has been\\nenormous.

His mouth was like the mouth of a\\nsensitive and very determined child. Jesse Bentley was\\na fanatic. He was a man born out of his time and place\\nand for this he suffered and made others suffer. Never\\ndid he succeed in getting what he wanted out of life\\nand he did not know what he wanted. Within a very short\\ntime after he came home to the Bentley farm he made\\neveryone there a little afraid of him, and his wife,\\nwho should have been close to him as his mother had\\nbeen, was afraid also. At the end of two weeks after\\nhis coming, old Tom Bentley made over to him the entire\\nownership of the place and retired into the background.\\nEveryone retired into the background. In spite of his\\nyouth and inexperience, Jesse had the trick of\\nmastering the souls of his people. He was so in earnest\\nin everything he did and said that no one understood\\nhim. He made everyone on the farm work as they had\\nnever worked before and yet there was no joy in the\\nwork. If things went well they went well for Jesse and\\nnever for the people who were his dependents. Like a\\nthousand other strong men who have come into the world\\nhere in America in these later times, Jesse was but\\nhalf strong. He could master others but he could not\\nmaster himself. The running of the farm as it had never\\nbeen run before was easy for him. When he came home\\nfrom Cleveland where he had been in school, he shut\\nhimself off from all of his people and began to make\\nplans. He thought about the farm night and day and that\\nmade him successful. Other men on the farms about him\\nworked too hard and were too fired to think, but to\\nthink of the farm and to be everlastingly making plans\\nfor its success was a relief to Jesse. It partially\\nsatisfied something in his passionate nature.\\nImmediately after he came home he had a wing built on\\nto the old house and in a large room facing the west he\\nhad windows that looked into the barnyard and other\\nwindows that looked off across the fields. By the\\nwindow he sat down to think. Hour after hour and day\\nafter day he sat and looked over the land and thought\\nout his new place in life. The passionate burning thing\\nin his nature flamed up and his eyes became hard. He\\nwanted to make the farm produce as no farm in his state\\nhad ever produced before and then he wanted something\\nelse. It was the indefinable hunger within that made\\nhis eyes waver and that kept him always more and more\\nsilent before people. He would have given much to\\nachieve peace and in him was a fear that peace was the\\nthing he could not achieve.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/24dc662faf8d2470/text/000000212\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/24dc662faf8d2470/text/000000212\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-24dc662faf8d2470-f09fcd twpub-24dc662faf8d2470-6b4cd0\\\"><p>All over his body Jesse Bentley was alive.

The greedy thing in\\nhim wanted to make money faster than it could be made\\nby tilling the land. More than once he went into\\nWinesburg to talk with his son-in-law John Hardy about\\nit. &quot;You are a banker and you will have chances I never\\nhad,&quot; he said and his eyes shone. &quot;I am thinking about\\nit all the time.
