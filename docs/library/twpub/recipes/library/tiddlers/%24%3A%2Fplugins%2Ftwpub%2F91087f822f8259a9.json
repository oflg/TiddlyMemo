me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels, with directions to hire some young gentleman of either university to put them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did, by my advice, in his book called “A Voyage round the world.” But I do not remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted, and much less that any thing should be inserted; therefore, as to the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind; particularly a paragraph about her majesty Queen Anne, of most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator, ought to have considered, that it was not my inclination, so was it not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master <i>Houyhnhnm</i>: And besides, the fact was altogether false; for to my knowledge, being in England during some part of her majesty’s reign, she did govern by a chief minister; nay even by two successively, the first whereof was the lord of Godolphin, and the second the lord of Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise in the account of the academy of projectors, and several passages of my discourse to my master <i>Houyhnhnm</i>, you have either omitted some material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner, that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving offence; that people in power were very watchful over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an <i>innuendo</i> (as I think you call it). But, pray how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of the <i>Yahoos</i>, who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time when I little thought, or feared, the unhappiness of living under them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very <i>Yahoos</i> carried by <i>Houyhnhnms</i> in a vehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures? And indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement hither.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000041\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000041\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000042\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000042\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to the trust I reposed in you.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000043\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000043\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000044\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000044\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good, that the <i>Yahoos</i> were a species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example: and so it has proved; for, instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as I had reason to expect; behold, after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book has produced one single effect according to my intentions. I desired you would let me know, by a letter, when party and faction were extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and modest, with some tincture of common sense, and Smithfield blazing with pyramids of law books; the young nobility’s education entirely changed; the physicians banished; the female <i>Yahoos</i> abounding in virtue, honour, truth, and good sense; courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit, and learning rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with their own ink. These, and a thousand other reformations, I firmly counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned, that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and folly to which <i>Yahoos</i> are subject, if their natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom. Yet, so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your letters; that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys, and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk; of degrading human nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not allow me to be the author of my own travels; and others make me author of books to which I am wholly a stranger.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000045\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000045\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000046\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000046\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I find likewise that your printer has been so careless as to confound the times, and mistake the dates, of my several voyages and returns; neither assigning the true year, nor the true month, nor day of the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since the publication of my book; neither have I any copy left: however, I have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them; but shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000047\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000047\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000048\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000048\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I hear some of our sea <i>Yahoos</i> find fault with my sea-language, as not proper in many parts, nor now in use.

When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my father: where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other relations, I got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months, knowing it would be useful in long voyages.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000069\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000069\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000070\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000070\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master, Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannel, commander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage or two into the Levant, and some other parts.

By an observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes south. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food; the rest were in a very weak condition. On the 5th of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within half a cable’s length of the ship; but the wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock. We rowed, by my computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship. We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they were all lost. For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide. I often let my legs drop, and could feel no bottom; but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was much abated. The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in the evening. I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a condition, that I did not observe them. I was extremely tired, and with that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remembered to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about nine hours; for when I awaked, it was just day-light. I attempted to rise, but was not able to stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my arm-pits to my thighs. I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me; but in the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured) following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but distinct voice, <i>Hekinah degul</i>: the others repeated the same words several times, but then I knew not what they meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness. At length, struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me excessive pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased I heard one of them cry aloud <i>Tolgo phonac</i>; when in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which, pricked me like so many needles; and besides, they shot another flight into the air, as we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body, (though I felt them not), and some on my face, which I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning with grief and pain; and then striving again to get loose, they discharged another volley larger than the first, and some of them attempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but by good luck I had on a buff jerkin, which they could not pierce. I thought it the most prudent method to lie still, and my design was to continue so till night, when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me, if they were all of the same size with him that I saw. But fortune disposed otherwise of me. When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows; but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and about four yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a knocking for above an hour, like that of people at work; when turning my head that way, as well as the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a foot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the inhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech, whereof I understood not one syllable. But I should have mentioned, that before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times, <i>Langro dehul san</i> (these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained to me); whereupon, immediately, about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head, which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak. He appeared to be of a middle age, and taller than any of the other three who attended him, whereof one was a page that held up his train, and seemed to be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on each side to support him. He acted every part of an orator, and I could observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity, and kindness. I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive manner, lifting up my left hand, and both my eyes to the sun, as calling him for a witness; and being almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the demands of nature so strong upon me, that I could not forbear showing my impatience (perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger frequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food. The <i>hurgo</i> (for so they call a great lord, as I afterwards learnt) understood me very well. He descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders should be applied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the king’s orders, upon the first intelligence he received of me. I observed there was the flesh of several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste. There were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and very well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them by two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the bigness of musket bullets. They supplied me as fast as they could, showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite. I then made another sign, that I wanted drink. They found by my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most ingenious people, they slung up, with great dexterity, one of their largest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top; I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more delicious. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same manner, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me. When I had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced upon my breast, repeating several times as they did at first, <i>Hekinah degul</i>. They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first warning the people below to stand out of the way, crying aloud, <i>Borach mevolah</i>; and when they saw the vessels in the air, there was a universal shout of <i>Hekinah degul</i>. I confess I was often tempted, while they were passing backwards and forwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach, and dash them against the ground. But the remembrance of what I had felt, which probably might not be the worst they could do, and the promise of honour I made them—for so I interpreted my submissive behaviour—soon drove out these imaginations. Besides, I now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality, to a people who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence. However, in my thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals, who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body, while one of my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious a creature as I must appear to them. After some time, when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there appeared before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty. His excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg, advanced forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue; and producing his credentials under the signet royal, which he applied close to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger, but with a kind of determinate resolution, often pointing forwards, which, as I afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half a mile distant; whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I must be conveyed. I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his excellency’s head for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty. It appeared that he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be carried as a prisoner. However, he made other signs to let me understand that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment. Whereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds; but again, when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased. Upon this, the <i>hurgo</i> and his train withdrew, with much civility and cheerful countenances. Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent repetitions of the words <i>Peplom selan</i>; and I felt great numbers of people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was able to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with making water; which I very plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the people; who, conjecturing by my motion what I was going to do, immediately opened to the right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent, which fell with such noise and violence from me. But before this, they had daubed my face and both my hands with a sort of ointment, very pleasant to the smell, which, in a few minutes, removed all the smart of their arrows. These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their victuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the emperor’s order, had mingled a sleepy potion in the hogsheads of wine.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000077\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000077\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000078\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000078\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It seems, that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the ground, after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it by an express; and determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner I have related, (which was done in the night while I slept;) that plenty of meat and drink should be sent to me, and a machine prepared to carry me to the capital city.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000079\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000079\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000080\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000080\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am confident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like occasion.

This prince has several machines fixed on wheels, for the carriage of trees and other great weights. He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea. Five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the greatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood raised three inches from the ground, about seven feet long, and four wide, moving upon twenty-two wheels. The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this engine, which, it seems, set out in four hours after my landing. It was brought parallel to me, as I lay. But the principal difficulty was to raise and place me in this vehicle. Eighty poles, each of one foot high, were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords, of the bigness of packthread, were fastened by hooks to many bandages, which the workmen had girt round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs. Nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords, by many pulleys fastened on the poles; and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised and slung into the engine, and there tied fast. All this I was told; for, while the operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by the force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor.

In this edifice it was determined I should lodge. The great gate fronting to the north was about four feet high, and almost two feet wide, through which I could easily creep. On each side of the gate was a small window, not above six inches from the ground: into that on the left side, the king’s smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that hang to a lady’s watch in Europe, and almost as large, which were locked to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks. Over against this temple, on the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there was a turret at least five feet high. Here the emperor ascended, with many principal lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me, as I was told, for I could not see them. It was reckoned that above a hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand; and, in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten thousand at several times, who mounted my body by the help of ladders. But a proclamation was soon issued, to forbid it upon pain of death. When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a disposition as ever I had in my life. But the noise and astonishment of the people, at seeing me rise and walk, are not to be expressed. The chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle, but, being fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and lie at my full length in the temple.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000087\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000087\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000088\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000088\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000089\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000089\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3>CHAPTER II.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000090\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000090\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000091\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000091\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"letter\\\">The emperor of Lilliput, attended by several of the nobility, comes to see the author in his confinement.

But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered my case, and the distress I was in. From this time my constant practice was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the full extent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before company came, that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows, by two servants appointed for that purpose. I would not have dwelt so long upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight, may appear not very momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my character, in point of cleanliness, to the world; which, I am told, some of my maligners have been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call in question.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000096\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000096\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000097\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000097\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house, having occasion for fresh air. The emperor was already descended from the tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have cost him dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up on its hinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept his seat, till his attendants ran in, and held the bridle, while his majesty had time to dismount. When he alighted, he surveyed me round with great admiration; but kept beyond the length of my chain. He ordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared, to give me victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon wheels, till I could reach them. I took these vehicles and soon emptied them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls; and I emptied the liquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest. The empress, and young princes of the blood of both sexes, attended by many ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident that happened to the emperor’s horse, they alighted, and came near his person, which I am now going to describe. He is taller by almost the breadth of my nail, than any of his court; which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders. His features are strong and masculine, with an Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions graceful, and his deportment majestic. He was then past his prime, being twenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he had reigned about seven in great felicity, and generally victorious. For the better convenience of beholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was parallel to his, and he stood but three yards off: however, I have had him since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the description. His dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it between the Asiatic and the European; but he had on his head a light helmet of gold, adorned with jewels, and a plume on the crest. He held his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself, if I should happen to break loose; it was almost three inches long; the hilt and scabbard were gold enriched with diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very clear and articulate; and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up. The ladies and courtiers were all most magnificently clad; so that the spot they stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground, embroidered with figures of gold and silver. His imperial majesty spoke often to me, and I returned answers: but neither of us could understand a syllable. There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I conjectured by their habits), who were commanded to address themselves to me; and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, and Lingua Franca, but all to no purpose. After about two hours the court retired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were very impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by the door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye. But the colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the butt-ends of their pikes into my reach. I took them all in my right hand, put five of them into my coat-pocket; and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as if I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled terribly, and the colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him gently on the ground, and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket; and I observed both the soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency, which was represented very much to my advantage at court.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000098\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000098\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000099\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000099\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Towards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time, the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.

They apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive, and might cause a famine. Sometimes they determined to starve me; or at least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would soon despatch me; but again they considered, that the stench of so large a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread through the whole kingdom. In the midst of these consultations, several officers of the army went to the door of the great council-chamber, and two of them being admitted, gave an account of my behaviour to the six criminals above-mentioned; which made so favourable an impression in the breast of his majesty and the whole board, in my behalf, that an imperial commission was issued out, obliging all the villages, nine hundred yards round the city, to deliver in every morning six beeves, forty sheep, and other victuals for my sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity of bread, and wine, and other liquors; for the due payment of which, his majesty gave assignments upon his treasury:—for this prince lives chiefly upon his own demesnes; seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any subsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at their own expense. An establishment was also made of six hundred persons to be my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance, and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door. It was likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of clothes, after the fashion of the country; that six of his majesty’s greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language; and lastly, that the emperor’s horses, and those of the nobility and troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom themselves to me. All these orders were duly put in execution; and in about three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language; during which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits, and was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me. We began already to converse together in some sort; and the first words I learnt, were to express my desire “that he would please give me my liberty;” which I every day repeated on my knees. His answer, as I could comprehend it, was, “that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council, and that first I must <i>lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon emposo</i>;” that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom. However, that I should be used with all kindness. And he advised me to “acquire, by my patience and discreet behaviour, the good opinion of himself and his subjects.” He desired “I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to certain proper officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me several weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered the bulk of so prodigious a person.” I said, “His majesty should be satisfied; for I was ready to strip myself, and turn up my pockets before him.” This I delivered part in words, and part in signs. He replied, “that, by the laws of the kingdom, I must be searched by two of his officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and assistance; and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice, as to trust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took from me, should be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them.” I took up the two officers in my hands, put them first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me, except my two fobs, and another secret pocket, which I had no mind should be searched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no consequence to any but myself. In one of my fobs there was a silver watch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse. These gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper, about them, made an exact inventory of every thing they saw; and when they had done, desired I would set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor. This inventory I afterwards translated into English, and is, word for word, as follows:</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000104\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000104\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000105\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000105\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><blockquote><div>\\n</div></blockquote></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000106\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000106\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><blockquote><div><p>“<i>Imprimis</i>: In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for so I interpret the words <i>quinbus flestrin</i>,) “after the strictest search, we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough to be a foot-cloth for your majesty’s chief room of state. In the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal, which we, the searchers, were not able to lift. We desired it should be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces set us both a sneezing for several times together. In his right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as the palm of our hands. In the left there was a sort of engine, from the back of which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the pallisados before your majesty’s court: wherewith we conjecture the man-mountain combs his head; for we did not always trouble him with questions, because we found it a great difficulty to make him understand us. In the large pocket, on the right side of his middle cover” (so I translate the word <i>ranfulo</i>, by which they meant my breeches,) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the length of a man, fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar; and upon one side of the pillar, were huge pieces of iron sticking out, cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make of. In the left pocket, another engine of the same kind. In the smaller pocket on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bottom of his pocket. One of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other there appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our heads. Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines. He took them out of their cases, and told us, that in his own country his practice was to shave his beard with one of these, and cut his meat with the other. There were two pockets which we could not enter: these he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover, but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly. Out of the right fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom. We directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and half of some transparent metal; for, on the transparent side, we saw certain strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them, till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance. He put this engine into our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that of a water-mill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal, or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter opinion, because he assured us, (if we understood him right, for he expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did any thing without consulting it. He called it his oracle, and said, it pointed out the time for every action of his life. From the left fob he took out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open and shut like a purse, and served him for the same use: we found therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real gold, must be of immense value.</p></div></blockquote></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000107\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000107\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><blockquote><div>\\n</div></blockquote></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000108\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000108\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><blockquote><div><p>“Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’s commands, diligently searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made of the hide of some prodigious animal, from which, on the left side, hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your majesty’s subjects.

He first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all. In the mean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then attended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows just ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for my eyes were wholly fixed upon his majesty. He then desired me to draw my scimitar, which, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was, in most parts, exceeding bright. I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a shout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the reflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my hand. His majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted than I could expect: he ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end of my chain. The next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols. I drew it out, and at his desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging it only with powder, which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to escape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent mariners take special care to provide,) I first cautioned the emperor not to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air. The astonishment here was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar. Hundreds fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even the emperor, although he stood his ground, could not recover himself for some time. I delivered up both my pistols in the same manner as I had done my scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from fire, for it would kindle with the smallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into the air. I likewise delivered up my watch, which the emperor was very curious to see, and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as draymen in England do a barrel of ale. He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their sight is much more acute than ours: he asked the opinions of his learned men about it, which were various and remote, as the reader may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could not very perfectly understand them.

The riders would leap them over my hand, as I held it on the ground; and one of the emperor’s huntsmen, upon a large courser, took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a prodigious leap. I had the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary manner. I desired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly; and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages, drawn by eight horses to each. I took nine of these sticks, and fixing them firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure, two feet and a half square, I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner, about two feet from the ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect; and extended it on all sides, till it was tight as the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks, rising about five inches higher than the handkerchief, served as ledges on each side. When I had finished my work, I desired the emperor to let a troop of his best horses twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain. His majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up, one by one, in my hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise them. As soon as they got into order they divided into two parties, performed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords, fled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in short discovered the best military discipline I ever beheld. The parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling over the stage; and the emperor was so much delighted, that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command; and with great difficulty persuaded even the empress herself to let me hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage, when she was able to take a full view of the whole performance. It was my good fortune, that no ill accident happened in these entertainments; only once a fiery horse, that belonged to one of the captains, pawing with his hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he overthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both, and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other, in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was strained in the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt; and I repaired my handkerchief as well as I could: however, I would not trust to the strength of it any more, in such dangerous enterprises.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000133\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000133\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000134\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000134\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was entertaining the court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express to inform his majesty, that some of his subjects, riding near the place where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on the ground, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round, as wide as his majesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man; that it was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it lay on the grass without motion; and some of them had walked round it several times; that, by mounting upon each other’s shoulders, they had got to the top, which was flat and even, and, stamping upon it, they found that it was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be something belonging to the man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased, they would undertake to bring it with only five horses. I presently knew what they meant, and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence. It seems, upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, I was in such confusion, that before I came to the place where I went to sleep, my hat, which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing, and had stuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I came to land; the string, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident, which I never observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea. I entreated his imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next day the waggoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition; they had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and half of the edge, and fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long cord to the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an English mile; but, the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level, it received less damage than I expected.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000135\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000135\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000136\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000136\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Two days after this adventure, the emperor, having ordered that part of his army which quarters in and about his metropolis, to be in readiness, took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner.

His majesty gave orders, upon pain of death, that every soldier in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my person; which however could not prevent some of the younger officers from turning up their eyes as they passed under me: and, to confess the truth, my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded some opportunities for laughter and admiration.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000137\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000137\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000138\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000138\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his majesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then in a full council; where it was opposed by none, except Skyresh Bolgolam, who was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy. But it was carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed by the emperor. That minister was <i>galbet</i>, or admiral of the realm, very much in his master’s confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose and sour complexion. However, he was at length persuaded to comply; but prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which I should be set free, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself. These articles were brought to me by Skyresh Bolgolam in person attended by two under-secretaries, and several persons of distinction. After they were read, I was demanded to swear to the performance of them; first in the manner of my own country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by their laws; which was, to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my thumb on the tip of my right ear. But because the reader may be curious to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that people, as well as to know the article upon which I recovered my liberty, I have made a

The wall which encompassed it is two feet and a half high, and at least eleven inches broad, so that a coach and horses may be driven very safely round it; and it is flanked with strong towers at ten feet distance. I stepped over the great western gate, and passed very gently, and sidling, through the two principal streets, only in my short waistcoat, for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the houses with the skirts of my coat. I walked with the utmost circumspection, to avoid treading on any stragglers who might remain in the streets, although the orders were very strict, that all people should keep in their houses, at their own peril. The garret windows and tops of houses were so crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels I had not seen a more populous place. The city is an exact square, each side of the wall being five hundred feet long. The two great streets, which run across and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide. The lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only view them as I passed, are from twelve to eighteen inches. The town is capable of holding five hundred thousand souls: the houses are from three to five stories: the shops and markets well provided.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000170\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000170\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000171\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000171\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The emperor’s palace is in the centre of the city where the two great streets meet. It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet distance from the buildings. I had his majesty’s permission to step over this wall; and, the space being so wide between that and the palace, I could easily view it on every side. The outward court is a square of forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely difficult; for the great gates, from one square into another, were but eighteen inches high, and seven inches wide. Now the buildings of the outer court were at least five feet high, and it was impossible for me to stride over them without infinite damage to the pile, though the walls were strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick. At the same time the emperor had a great desire that I should see the magnificence of his palace; but this I was not able to do till three days after, which I spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city. Of these trees I made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear my weight. The people having received notice a second time, I went again through the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands. When I came to the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the other in my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it down on the space between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide. I then stept over the building very conveniently from one stool to the other, and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick. By this contrivance I got into the inmost court; and, lying down upon my side, I applied my face to the windows of the middle stories, which were left open on purpose, and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be imagined. There I saw the empress and the young princes, in their several lodgings, with their chief attendants about them. Her imperial majesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me, and gave me out of the window her hand to kiss.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000172\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000172\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000173\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000173\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But I shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of this kind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now almost ready for the press; containing a general description of this empire, from its first erection, through a long series of princes; with a particular account of their wars and politics, laws, learning, and religion; their plants and animals; their peculiar manners and customs, with other matters very curious and useful; my chief design at present being only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the public or to myself during a residence of about nine months in that empire.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000174\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000174\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000175\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000175\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty, Reldresal, principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs, came to my house attended only by one servant. He ordered his coach to wait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hour’s audience; which I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal merits, as well as of the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations at court. I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently reach my ear, but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our conversation. He began with compliments on my liberty; said “he might pretend to some merit in it;” but, however, added, “that if it had not been for the present situation of things at court, perhaps I might not have obtained it so soon. For,” said he, “as flourishing a condition as we may appear to be in to foreigners, we labour under two mighty evils: a violent faction at home, and the danger of an invasion, by a most potent enemy, from abroad. As to the first, you are to understand, that for about seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties in this empire, under the names of <i>Tramecksan</i> and <i>Slamecksan</i>, from the high and low heels of their shoes, by which they distinguish themselves. It is alleged, indeed, that the high heels are most agreeable to our ancient constitution; but, however this be, his majesty has determined to make use only of low heels in the administration of the government, and all offices in the gift of the crown, as you cannot but observe; and particularly that his majesty’s imperial heels are lower at least by a <i>drurr</i> than any of his court (<i>drurr</i> is a measure about the fourteenth part of an inch). The animosities between these two parties run so high, that they will neither eat, nor drink, nor talk with each other. We compute the <i>Tramecksan</i>, or high heels, to exceed us in number; but the power is wholly on our side. We apprehend his imperial highness, the heir to the crown, to have some tendency towards the high heels; at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait. Now, in the midst of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from the island of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe, almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty. For as to what we have heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a hundred mortals of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of his majesty’s dominions: besides, our histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu. Which two mighty powers have, as I was going to tell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six-and-thirty moons past. It began upon the following occasion. It is allowed on all hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the larger end; but his present majesty’s grandfather, while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers. Whereupon the emperor his father published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end of their eggs. The people so highly resented this law, that our histories tell us, there have been six rebellions raised on that account; wherein one emperor lost his life, and another his crown. These civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that empire. It is computed that eleven thousand persons have at several times suffered death, rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end. Many hundred large volumes have been published upon this controversy: but the books of the Big-endians have been long forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding employments. During the course of these troubles, the emperors of Blefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors, accusing us of making a schism in religion, by offending against a fundamental doctrine of our great prophet Lustrog, in the fifty-fourth chapter of the Blundecral (which is their Alcoran). This, however, is thought to be a mere strain upon the text; for the words are these: ‘that all true believers break their eggs at the convenient end.’ And which is the convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion to be left to every man’s conscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to determine. Now, the Big-endian exiles have found so much credit in the emperor of Blefuscu’s court, and so much private assistance and encouragement from their party here at home, that a bloody war has been carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons, with various success; during which time we have lost forty capital ships, and a much a greater number of smaller vessels, together with thirty thousand of our best seamen and soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours. However, they have now equipped a numerous fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon us; and his imperial majesty, placing great confidence in your valour and strength, has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before you.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000176\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000176\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000177\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000177\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor; and to let him know, “that I thought it would not become me, who was a foreigner, to interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the hazard of my life, to defend his person and state against all invaders.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000178\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000178\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000179\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000179\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000180\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000180\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3>CHAPTER V.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000181\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000181\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000182\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000182\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"letter\\\">The author, by an extraordinary stratagem, prevents an invasion.

I had not yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended invasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of being discovered, by some of the enemy’s ships, who had received no intelligence of me; all intercourse between the two empires having been strictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an embargo laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever. I communicated to his majesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy’s whole fleet; which, as our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbour, ready to sail with the first fair wind. I consulted the most experienced seamen upon the depth of the channel, which they had often plumbed; who told me, that in the middle, at high-water, it was seventy <i>glumgluffs</i> deep, which is about six feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty <i>glumgluffs</i> at most. I walked towards the north-east coast, over against Blefuscu, where, lying down behind a hillock, I took out my small perspective glass, and viewed the enemy’s fleet at anchor, consisting of about fifty men of war, and a great number of transports: I then came back to my house, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant) for a great quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron. The cable was about as thick as packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle. I trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason I twisted three of the iron bars together, bending the extremities into a hook. Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the north-east coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea, in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before high water. I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle about thirty yards, till I felt ground. I arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so frightened when they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand souls. I then took my tackling, and, fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords together at the end. While I was thus employed, the enemy discharged several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face, and, beside the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my work. My greatest apprehension was for my eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not suddenly thought of an expedient. I kept, among other little necessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I observed before, had escaped the emperor’s searchers. These I took out and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on boldly with my work, in spite of the enemy’s arrows, many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect, further than a little to discompose them. I had now fastened all the hooks, and, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the boldest part of my enterprise remained. I therefore let go the cord, and leaving the hooks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors, receiving about two hundred shots in my face and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables, to which my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy’s largest men of war after me.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000185\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000185\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000186\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000186\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended, were at first confounded with astonishment.

But being now a <i>nardac</i> of the highest rank in that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and the emperor (to do him justice), never once mentioned them to me. However, it was not long before I had an opportunity of doing his majesty, at least as I then thought, a most signal service. I was alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door; by which, being suddenly awaked, I was in some kind of terror. I heard the word <i>Burglum</i> repeated incessantly: several of the emperor’s court, making their way through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to the palace, where her imperial majesty’s apartment was on fire, by the carelessness of a maid of honour, who fell asleep while she was reading a romance. I got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the way before me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift to get to the palace without trampling on any of the people. I found they had already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and were well provided with buckets, but the water was at some distance. These buckets were about the size of large thimbles, and the poor people supplied me with them as fast as they could: but the flame was so violent that they did little good. I might easily have stifled it with my coat, which I unfortunately left behind me for haste, and came away only in my leathern jerkin. The case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable; and this magnificent palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the ground, if, by a presence of mind unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an expedient. I had, the evening before, drunk plentifully of a most delicious wine called <i>glimigrim</i>, (the Blefuscudians call it <i>flunec</i>, but ours is esteemed the better sort,) which is very diuretic. By the luckiest chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of it. The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames, and by labouring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate by urine; which I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places, that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from destruction.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000201\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000201\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000202\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000202\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was now day-light, and I returned to my house without waiting to congratulate with the emperor: because, although I had done a very eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might resent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental laws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality soever, to make water within the precincts of the palace.

When the girls are twelve years old, which among them is the marriageable age, their parents or guardians take them home, with great expressions of gratitude to the professors, and seldom without tears of the young lady and her companions.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000238\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000238\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000239\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000239\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their several degrees: those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years old, the rest are kept to eleven.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000240\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000240\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000241\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000241\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The meaner families who have children at these nurseries, are obliged, besides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to return to the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings, to be a portion for the child; and therefore all parents are limited in their expenses by the law.

Having a head mechanically turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal park. Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which, however, they were forced to quilt together in several folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn. Their linen is usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece. The sempstresses took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end, while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch long. Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they fitted me exactly. Three hundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my measure. I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat: but my waist and arms I measured myself. When my clothes were finished, which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in England, only that mine were all of a colour.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000246\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000246\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000247\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000247\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient huts built about my house, where they and their families lived, and prepared me two dishes a-piece.

A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught. Their mutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent.

The treasurer took a fancy to be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who informed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person; and the court scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to my lodging. This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood, without any grounds, further than that her grace was pleased to treat me with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship. I own she came often to my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the coach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and some particular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the court. And I still appeal to my servants round, whether they at any time saw a coach at my door, without knowing what persons were in it. On those occasions, when a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go immediately to the door, and, after paying my respects, to take up the coach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for, if there were six horses, the postillion always unharnessed four,) and place them on a table, where I had fixed a movable rim quite round, of five inches high, to prevent accidents. And I have often had four coaches and horses at once on my table, full of company, while I sat in my chair, leaning my face towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen would gently drive the others round my table. I have passed many an afternoon very agreeably in these conversations. But I defy the treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make the best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me <i>incognito</i>, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent by express command of his imperial majesty, as I have before related. I should not have dwelt so long upon this particular, if it had not been a point wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned, to say nothing of my own; though I then had the honour to be a <i>nardac</i>, which the treasurer himself is not; for all the world knows, that he is only a <i>glumglum</i>, a title inferior by one degree, as that of a marquis is to a duke in England; yet I allow he preceded me in right of his post. These false informations, which I afterwards came to the knowledge of by an accident not proper to mention, made the treasurer show his lady for some time an ill countenance, and me a worse; and although he was at last undeceived and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and found my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself, who was, indeed, too much governed by that favourite.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000252\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000252\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000253\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000253\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000254\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000254\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000255\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000255\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000256\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000256\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"letter\\\">The author, being informed of a design to accuse him of high-treason, makes his escape to Blefuscu.

This speech was immediately published throughout the kingdom; nor did any thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty’s mercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer more innocent. Yet, as to myself, I must confess, having never been designed for a courtier, either by my birth or education, I was so ill a judge of things, that I could not discover the lenity and favour of this sentence, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous than gentle. I sometimes thought of standing my trial, for, although I could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped they would admit of some extenuation. But having in my life perused many state-trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought fit to direct, I durst not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so critical a juncture, and against such powerful enemies. Once I was strongly bent upon resistance, for, while I had liberty the whole strength of that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project with horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the emperor, the favours I received from him, and the high title of <i>nardac</i> he conferred upon me.

But hurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his imperial majesty’s license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu, I took this opportunity, before the three days were elapsed, to send a letter to my friend the secretary, signifying my resolution of setting out that morning for Blefuscu, pursuant to the leave I had got; and, without waiting for an answer, I went to that side of the island where our fleet lay. I seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow, and, lifting up the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together with my coverlet, which I carried under my arm) into the vessel, and, drawing it after me, between wading and swimming arrived at the royal port of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me: they lent me two guides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name. I held them in my hands, till I came within two hundred yards of the gate, and desired them “to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries, and let him know, I there waited his majesty’s command.” I had an answer in about an hour, “that his majesty, attended by the royal family, and great officers of the court, was coming out to receive me.” I advanced a hundred yards.

I pulled off my shoes and stockings, and, wading two or three hundred yards, I found the object to approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a real boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a ship. Whereupon, I returned immediately towards the city, and desired his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had left, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the command of his vice-admiral. This fleet sailed round, while I went back the shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the boat. I found the tide had driven it still nearer. The seamen were all provided with cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength. When the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a hundred yards of the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got up to it. The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a hole in the fore-part of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but I found all my labour to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I was not able to work. In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and push the boat forward, as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the tide favouring me, I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin and feel the ground. I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the boat another shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my arm-pits; and now, the most laborious part being over, I took out my other cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastened them first to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the wind being favourable, the seamen towed, and I shoved, until we arrived within forty yards of the shore; and, waiting till the tide was out, I got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men, with ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it was but little damaged.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000324\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000324\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000325\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000325\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under, by the help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people appeared upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vessel.

I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the lee-side of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited. I then took some refreshment, and went to my rest. I slept well, and as I conjectured at least six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours after I awaked. It was a clear night. I ate my breakfast before the sun was up; and heaving anchor, the wind being favourable, I steered the same course that I had done the day before, wherein I was directed by my pocket compass. My intention was to reach, if possible, one of those islands which I had reason to believe lay to the north-east of Van Diemen’s Land. I discovered nothing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the afternoon, when I had by my computation made twenty-four leagues from Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the south-east; my course was due east. I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind slackened. I made all the sail I could, and in half an hour she spied me, then hung out her ancient, and discharged a gun. It is not easy to express the joy I was in, upon the unexpected hope of once more seeing my beloved country, and the dear pledges I left in it. The ship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five and six in the evening, September 26th; but my heart leaped within me to see her English colours. I put my cows and sheep into my coat-pockets, and got on board with all my little cargo of provisions. The vessel was an English merchantman, returning from Japan by the North and South seas; the captain, Mr. John Biddel, of Deptford, a very civil man, and an excellent sailor.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000340\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000340\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000341\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000341\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>We were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty men in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter Williams, who gave me a good character to the captain.

The rest of my cattle I got safe ashore, and set them a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the fineness of the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had always feared the contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a voyage, if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit, which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was their constant food. The short time I continued in England, I made a considerable profit by showing my cattle to many persons of quality and others: and before I began my second voyage, I sold them for six hundred pounds. Since my last return I find the breed is considerably increased, especially the sheep, which I hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen manufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000344\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000344\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000345\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000345\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I stayed but two months with my wife and family, for my insatiable desire of seeing foreign countries, would suffer me to continue no longer.

On the 17th, we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for we knew not whether;) on the south side whereof was a small neck of land jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above one hundred tons. We cast anchor within a league of this creek, and our captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the long-boat, with vessels for water, if any could be found. I desired his leave to go with them, that I might see the country, and make what discoveries I could. When we came to land we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of inhabitants. Our men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the sea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other side, where I observed the country all barren and rocky. I now began to be weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my curiosity, I returned gently down towards the creek; and the sea being full in my view, I saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing for life to the ship. I was going to holla after them, although it had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge creature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not much deeper than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had the start of him half a league, and, the sea thereabouts being full of sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat. This I was afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the issue of the adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and then climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country. I found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the length of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for hay, was about twenty feet high.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000362\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000362\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000363\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000363\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley. Here I walked on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an hour walking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could make no computation of their altitude. There was a stile to pass from this field into the next. It had four steps, and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost. It was impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was six-feet high, and the upper stone about twenty. I was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards the stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our boat. He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about ten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess. I was struck with the utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn, whence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field on the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than a speaking-trumpet: but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I certainly thought it was thunder. Whereupon seven monsters, like himself, came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook about the largeness of six scythes. These people were not so well clad as the first, whose servants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay. I kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt them. However, I made a shift to go forward, till I came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind. Here it was impossible for me to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven, that I could not creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed, that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh. At the same time I heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me. Being quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and dispair, I lay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my days. I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children. I lamented my own folly and wilfulness, in attempting a second voyage, against the advice of all my friends and relations. In this terrible agitation of mind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world; where I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and perform those other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the chronicles of that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although attested by millions. I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me, to appear as inconsiderable in this nation, as one single Lilliputian would be among us. But this I conceived was to be the least of my misfortunes; for, as human creatures are observed to be more savage and cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that should happen to seize me? Undoubtedly philosophers are in the right, when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by comparison. It might have pleased fortune, to have let the Lilliputians find some nation, where the people were as diminutive with respect to them, as they were to me. And who knows but that even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000364\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000364\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000365\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000365\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these reflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of the ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I should be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping-hook. And therefore, when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as fear could make me: whereupon the huge creature trod short, and, looking round about under him for some time, at last espied me as I lay on the ground. He considered awhile, with the caution of one who endeavours to lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not be able either to scratch or bite him, as I myself have sometimes done with a weasel in England. At length he ventured to take me behind, by the middle, between his fore-finger and thumb, and brought me within three yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly. I guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the air above sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers. All I ventured was to raise my eyes towards the sun, and place my hands together in a supplicating posture, and to speak some words in a humble melancholy tone, suitable to the condition I then was in: for I apprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usually do any little hateful animal, which we have a mind to destroy. But my good star would have it, that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and began to look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate words, although he could not understand them. In the mean time I was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning my head towards my sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how cruelly I was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger. He seemed to apprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was a substantial farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000366\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000366\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000367\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000367\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The farmer having (as I suppose by their talk) received such an account of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature had given me. He blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face. He called his hinds about him, and asked them, as I afterwards learned, whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that resembled me. He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but I got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let those people see I had no intent to run away. They all sat down in a circle about me, the better to observe my motions. I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards the farmer. I fell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him. He received it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of a pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it. Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground. I then took the purse, and, opening it, poured all the gold into his palm. There were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or thirty smaller coins. I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were.

It was only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a husbandman,) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter. The company were, the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old grandmother. When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some distance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the floor. I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the edge, for fear of falling. The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled some bread on a trencher, and placed it before me. I made her a low bow, took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them exceeding delight. The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held about two gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up the vessel with much difficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful manner drank to her ladyship’s health, expressing the words as loud as I could in English, which made the company laugh so heartily, that I was almost deafened with the noise. This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was not unpleasant. Then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher side; but as I walked on the table, being in great surprise all the time, as the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to stumble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt. I got up immediately, and observing the good people to be in much concern, I took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners,) and waving it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had got no mischief by my fall. But advancing forward towards my master (as I shall henceforth call him,) his youngest son, who sat next to him, an arch boy of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in the air, that I trembled every limb: but his father snatched me from him, and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear, as would have felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering him to be taken from the table. But being afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and well remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and pointing to the boy, made my master to understand, as well as I could, that I desired his son might be pardoned. The father complied, and the lad took his seat again, whereupon I went to him, and kissed his hand, which my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000372\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000372\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000373\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000373\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the midst of dinner, my mistress’s favourite cat leaped into her lap.

The fierceness of this creature’s countenance altogether discomposed me; though I stood at the farther end of the table, above fifty feet off; and although my mistress held her fast, for fear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons. But it happened there was no danger, for the cat took not the least notice of me when my master placed me within three yards of her.

I walked with intrepidity five or six times before the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; whereupon she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me: I had less apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the room, as it is usual in farmers’ houses; one of which was a mastiff, equal in bulk to four elephants, and another a greyhound, somewhat taller than the mastiff, but not so large.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000374\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000374\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000375\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000375\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you might have heard from London Bridge to Chelsea, after the usual oratory of infants, to get me for a plaything. The mother, out of pure indulgence, took me up, and put me towards the child, who presently seized me by the middle, and got my head into his mouth, where I roared so loud that the urchin was frighted, and let me drop, and I should infallibly have broke my neck, if the mother had not held her apron under me. The nurse, to quiet her babe, made use of a rattle which was a kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones, and fastened by a cable to the child’s waist: but all in vain; so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by giving it suck. I must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the sight of her monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape, and colour. It stood prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen in circumference. The nipple was about half the bigness of my head, and the hue both of that and the dug, so varied with spots, pimples, and freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near sight of her, she sitting down, the more conveniently to give suck, and I standing on the table. This made me reflect upon the fair skins of our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying glass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins look rough, and coarse, and ill-coloured.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000376\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000376\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000377\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000377\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those diminutive people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view, when I took him up in my hand, and brought him close, which he confessed was at first a very shocking sight. He said, “he could discover great holes in my skin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the bristles of a boar, and my complexion made up of several colours altogether disagreeable:” although I must beg leave to say for myself, that I am as fair as most of my sex and country, and very little sunburnt by all my travels. On the other side, discoursing of the ladies in that emperor’s court, he used to tell me, “one had freckles; another too wide a mouth; a third too large a nose;” nothing of which I was able to distinguish. I confess this reflection was obvious enough; which, however, I could not forbear, lest the reader might think those vast creatures were actually deformed: for I must do them the justice to say, they are a comely race of people, and particularly the features of my master’s countenance, although he was but a farmer, when I beheld him from the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000378\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000378\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000379\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000379\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>When dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as I could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to take care of me.

My mistress was gone about her household affairs, and had locked me in. The bed was eight yards from the floor. Some natural necessities required me to get down; I durst not presume to call; and if I had, it would have been in vain, with such a voice as mine, at so great a distance from the room where I lay to the kitchen where the family kept. While I was under these circumstances, two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the bed. One of them came up almost to my face, whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend myself. These horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his forefeet at my collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief. He fell down at my feet; and the other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape, but not without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled, and made the blood run trickling from him. After this exploit, I walked gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of spirits. These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but infinitely more nimble and fierce; so that if I had taken off my belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured. I measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yards long, wanting an inch; but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off the bed, where it lay still bleeding; I observed it had yet some life, but with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000382\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000382\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000383\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000383\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, ran and took me up in her hand.

This was my bed all the time I staid with those people, though made more convenient by degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known. This young girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled off my clothes before her, she was able to dress and undress me, though I never gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself. She made me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be got, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly washed for me with her own hands. She was likewise my school-mistress, to teach me the language: when I pointed to any thing, she told me the name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call for whatever I had a mind to. She was very good-natured, and not above forty feet high, being little for her age. She gave me the name of <i>Grildrig</i>, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.

He had the character of a great miser; and, to my misfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master, to show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town, which was half an hour’s riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house. I guessed there was some mischief when I observed my master and his friend whispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy that I overheard and understood some of their words. But the next morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which she had cunningly picked out from her mother. The poor girl laid me on her bosom, and fell a weeping with shame and grief. She apprehended some mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands. She had also observed how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my honour, and what an indignity I should conceive it, to be exposed for money as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people. She said, her papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now she found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher. For my own part, I may truly affirm, that I was less concerned than my nurse. I had a strong hope, which never left me, that I should one day recover my liberty: and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country, and that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach, if ever I should return to England, since the king of Great Britain himself, in my condition, must have undergone the same distress.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000395\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000395\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000396\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000396\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>My master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box the next market-day to the neighbouring town, and took along with him his little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.

I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced to a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. While he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself, a <i>sardral</i>, or gentleman-usher, came from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for the diversion of the queen and her ladies. Some of the latter had already been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty, behaviour, and good sense. Her majesty, and those who attended her, were beyond measure delighted with my demeanour. I fell on my knees, and begged the honour of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the table, which I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip. She made me some general questions about my country and my travels, which I answered as distinctly, and in as few words as I could. She asked, “whether I could be content to live at court?” I bowed down to the board of the table, and humbly answered “that I was my master’s slave: but, if I were at my own disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to her majesty’s service.” She then asked my master, “whether he was willing to sell me at a good price?” He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was ready enough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which were ordered him on the spot, each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred moidores; but allowing for the proportion of all things between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in England. I then said to the queen, “since I was now her majesty’s most humble creature and vassal, I must beg the favour, that Glumdalclitch, who had always tended me with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and instructor.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000414\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000414\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000415\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000415\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Her majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer’s consent, who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor girl herself was not able to hide her joy.

These gentlemen, after they had a while examined my shape with much nicety, were of different opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could not be produced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was not framed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, or climbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth. They observed by my teeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a carnivorous animal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and field mice, with some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be able to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other insects, which they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not possibly do. One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I might be an embryo, or abortive birth. But this opinion was rejected by the other two, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished; and that I had lived several years, as it was manifest from my beard, the stumps whereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying glass. They would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all degrees of comparison; for the queen’s favourite dwarf, the smallest ever known in that kingdom, was near thirty feet high. After much debate, they concluded unanimously, that I was only <i>relplum scalcath</i>, which is interpreted literally <i>lusus naturæ</i>; a determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors, disdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of Aristotle endeavoured in vain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000426\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000426\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000427\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000427\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two. I applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, “that I came from a country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in proportion, and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend myself, and to find sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could do here; which I took for a full answer to those gentlemen’s arguments.” To this they only replied with a smile of contempt, saying, “that the farmer had instructed me very well in my lesson.” The king, who had a much better understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by good fortune was not yet gone out of town. Having therefore first examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be true. He desired the queen to order that a particular care should be taken of me; and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue in her office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection for each other. A convenient apartment was provided for her at court: she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself. The queen commanded her own cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon. This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a London bed-chamber. The board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty’s upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me. A nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in. The room was quilted on all sides, as well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any accident from the carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the force of a jolt, when I went in a coach. I desired a lock for my door, to prevent rats and mice from coming in. The smith, after several attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have known a larger at the gate of a gentleman’s house in England. I made a shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might lose it. The queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them. They were after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000428\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000428\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000429\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000429\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without me.

I had an entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what I have seen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house: these my little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as I wanted them, always cleaning them herself. No person dined with the queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest sixteen years old, and the younger at that time thirteen and a month. Her majesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and her diversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen (who had indeed but a weak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a very nauseous sight. She would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all, between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of a full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two twelve-penny loaves. She drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at a draught. Her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon the handle. The spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the same proportion. I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of curiosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had never till then beheld so terrible a sight.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000430\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000430\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000431\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000431\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is their Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes, dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become a great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were placed at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars.

But I confess, that, after I had been a little too copious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the prejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other, after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether I was a whig or tory?” Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed “how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet,” says he, “I dare engage these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a figure in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray!” And thus he continued on, while my colour came and went several times, with indignation, to hear our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so contemptuously treated.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000432\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000432\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000433\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000433\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature thoughts I began to doubt whether I was injured or no.

They would sometimes alight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement, or spawn behind, which to me was very visible, though not to the natives of that country, whose large optics were not so acute as mine, in viewing smaller objects. Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or forehead, where they stung me to the quick, smelling very offensively; and I could easily trace that viscous matter, which, our naturalists tell us, enables those creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling. I had much ado to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear starting when they came on my face. It was the common practice of the dwarf, to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as schoolboys do among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten me, and divert the queen.

It is in length three <i>glomglungs</i> (which make about fifty-four English miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as I measured it myself in the royal map made by the king’s order, which was laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: I paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and, computing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000453\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000453\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000454\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000454\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The king’s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about seven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty feet high, and broad and long in proportion. A coach was allowed to Glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to see the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party, carried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view the houses and the people, as we passed along the streets. I reckoned our coach to be about a square of Westminster-hall, but not altogether so high: however, I cannot be very exact. One day the governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops, where the beggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach, and gave me the most horrible spectacle that ever a European eye beheld. There was a woman with a cancer in her breast, swelled to a monstrous size, full of holes, in two or three of which I could have easily crept, and covered my whole body. There was a fellow with a wen in his neck, larger than five wool-packs; and another, with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty feet high. But the most hateful sight of all, was the lice crawling on their clothes. I could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my naked eye, much better than those of a European louse through a microscope, and their snouts with which they rooted like swine. They were the first I had ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough to dissect one of them, if I had had proper instruments, which I unluckily left behind me in the ship, although, indeed, the sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000455\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000455\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000456\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000456\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered a smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten high, for the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat too large for Glumdalclitch’s lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was made by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance. This travelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys. On the fourth side, which had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the person that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a leathern belt, and buckled it about his waist. This was always the office of some grave trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I attended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court, when Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I soon began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose more upon account of their majesties’ favour, than any merit of my own. In journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there I had a full prospect of the country on three sides, from my three windows. I had, in this closet, a field-bed and a hammock, hung from the ceiling, two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach. And having been long used to sea-voyages, those motions, although sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000457\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000457\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000458\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000458\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my travelling-closet; which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by two others in the queen’s livery.

But, not to detract from a nation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge myself extremely obliged, it must be allowed, that whatever this famous tower wants in height, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the walls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut in marble, larger than the life, placed in their several niches. I measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet and an inch in length.

While she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that belonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I lay: the dog, following the scent, came directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran straight to his master wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground. By good fortune he had been so well taught, that I was carried between his teeth without the least hurt, or even tearing my clothes. But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and had a great kindness for me, was in a terrible fright: he gently took me up in both his hands, and asked me how I did? but I was so amazed and out of breath, that I could not speak a word. In a few minutes I came to myself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who, by this time, had returned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she called. She severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog. But the thing was hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was afraid of the queen’s anger; and truly, as to myself, I thought it would not be for my reputation, that such a story should go about.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000476\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000476\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000477\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000477\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me abroad for the future out of her sight.

I remember, a thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a piece of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast. When I attempted to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my fingers, which I durst not venture within their reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails, as they did before. But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my strength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.

But I was soon relieved by one of our servants, who wrung off the bird’s neck, and I had him next day for dinner, by the queen’s command.

I answered, that I understood both very well: for although my proper employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was forced to work like a common mariner. But I could not see how this could be done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to a first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as I could manage would never live in any of their rivers. Her majesty said, if I would contrive a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a place for me to sail in. The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my instructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its tackling, able conveniently to hold eight Europeans. When it was finished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap to the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water, with me in it, by way of trial, where I could not manage my two sculls, or little oars, for want of room. But the queen had before contrived another project. She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well pitched, to prevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall, in an outer room of the palace. It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water, when it began to grow stale; and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour. Here I often used to row for my own diversion, as well as that of the queen and her ladies, who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and agility. Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my business was only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and, when they were weary, some of their pages would blow my sail forward with their breath, while I showed my art by steering starboard or larboard as I pleased. When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried back my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000488\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000488\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000489\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000489\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to place me in the boat: but I happened to slip through her fingers, and should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the luckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a corking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; the head of the pin passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus I was held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000490\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000490\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000491\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000491\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail.

I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last forced it to leap out of the boat.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000492\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000492\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000493\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000493\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen. Glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business, or a visit. The weather being very warm, the closet-window was left open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency. As I sat quietly meditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat, although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring from my seat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window. I retreated to the farther corner of my room; or box; but the monkey looking in at every side, put me in such a fright, that I wanted presence of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done. After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last espied me; and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to avoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that country silk, was very thick and strong), and dragged me out. He took me up in his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is going to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a kitten in Europe; and when I offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to submit. I have good reason to believe, that he took me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking my face very gently with his other paw. In these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening it: whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon the leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours. I heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me out. The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding me like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they justly ought to be blamed, for, without question, the sight was ridiculous enough to every body but myself. Some of the people threw up stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this was strictly forbidden, or else, very probably, my brains had been dashed out.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000494\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000494\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000495\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000495\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men; which the monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile, and made his escape.

He asked me, “what my thoughts and speculations were, while I lay in the monkey’s paw; how I liked the victuals he gave me; his manner of feeding; and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach.” He desired to know, “what I would have done upon such an occasion in my own country.” I told his majesty, “that in Europe we had no monkeys, except such as were brought for curiosity from other places, and so small, that I could deal with a dozen of them together, if they presumed to attack me. And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was so lately engaged (it was indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make use of my hanger,” (looking fiercely, and clapping my hand on the hilt, as I spoke) “when he poked his paw into my chamber, perhaps I should have given him such a wound, as would have made him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in.” This I delivered in a firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage should be called in question. However, my speech produced nothing else beside a loud laughter, which all the respect due to his majesty from those about him could not make them contain. This made me reflect, how vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him. And yet I have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in England since my return; where a little contemptible varlet, without the least title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with importance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000500\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000500\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000501\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000501\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to inform the queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought would be diverting to her majesty.

Glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a week to teach her: I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that instrument, and was played upon in the same manner. A fancy came into my head, that I would entertain the king and queen with an English tune upon this instrument. But this appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with my arms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and to press them down required a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great a labour, and to no purpose. The method I contrived was this: I prepared two round sticks, about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker at one end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with pieces of a mouse’s skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the tops of the keys nor interrupt the sound. Before the spinet a bench was placed, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the bench. I ran sideling upon it, that way and this, as fast as I could, banging the proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the great satisfaction of both their majesties; but it was the most violent exercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not strike above sixteen keys, nor consequently play the bass and treble together, as other artists do; which was a great disadvantage to my performance.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000515\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000515\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000516\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000516\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent understanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my box, and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards distance upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his face.

He desired “I would give him as exact an account of the government of England as I possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000517\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000517\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000518\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000518\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Imagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the tongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits and felicity.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000519\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000519\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000520\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000520\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I began my discourse by informing his majesty, that our dominions consisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under one sovereign, beside our plantations in America.

To these were joined several holy persons, as part of that assembly, under the title of bishops, whose peculiar business is to take care of religion, and of those who instruct the people therein. These were searched and sought out through the whole nation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors, among such of the priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the spiritual fathers of the clergy and the people.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000521\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000521\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000522\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000522\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>That the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked and culled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and love of their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation.

That a proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or iron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead, with such violence and speed, as nothing was able to sustain its force. That the largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when linked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.

Neither do I say this, with the least intention to detract from the many virtues of that excellent king, whose character, I am sensible, will, on this account, be very much lessened in the opinion of an English reader: but I take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance, by not having hitherto reduced politics into a science, as the more acute wits of Europe have done. For, I remember very well, in a discourse one day with the king, when I happened to say, “there were several thousand books among us written upon the art of government,” it gave him (directly contrary to my intention) a very mean opinion of our understandings. He professed both to abominate and despise all mystery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a minister. He could not tell what I meant by secrets of state, where an enemy, or some rival nation, were not in the case. He confined the knowledge of governing within very narrow bounds, to common sense and reason, to justice and lenity, to the speedy determination of civil and criminal causes; with some other obvious topics, which are not worth considering. And he gave it for his opinion, “that whoever could make two ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put together.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000558\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000558\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000559\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000559\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in morality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be allowed to excel.

I have perused many of their books, especially those in history and morality. Among the rest, I was much diverted with a little old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch’s bed chamber, and belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in writings of morality and devotion. The book treats of the weakness of humankind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the vulgar. However, I was curious to see what an author of that country could say upon such a subject. This writer went through all the usual topics of European moralists, showing “how diminutive, contemptible, and helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend himself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts: how much he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed, by a third in foresight, by a fourth in industry.” He added, “that nature was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could now produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in ancient times.” He said “it was very reasonable to think, not only that the species of men were originally much larger, but also that there must have been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually dug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled race of men in our days.” He argued, “that the very laws of nature absolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size more large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little accident, of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand of a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.” From this way of reasoning, the author drew several moral applications, useful in the conduct of life, but needless here to repeat. For my own part, I could not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of drawing lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining, from the quarrels we raise with nature. And I believe, upon a strict inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they are among that people.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000566\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000566\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000567\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000567\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>As to their military affairs, they boast that the king’s army consists of a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand horse: if that may be called an army, which is made up of tradesmen in the several cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are only the nobility and gentry, without pay or reward.

Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued: I had gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to her chamber. I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of my escape, if ever it should happen. I pretended to be worse than I really was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a page, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with me. I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch consented, nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me, bursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some forboding of what was to happen. The boy took me out in my box, about half an hour’s walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the sea-shore. I ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many a wistful melancholy look towards the sea. I found myself not very well, and told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which I hoped would do me good. I got in, and the boy shut the window close down, to keep out the cold. I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture is, while I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among the rocks to look for birds’ eggs, having before observed him from my window searching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts. Be that as it will, I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring, which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of carriage. I felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne forward with prodigious speed. The first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock, but afterward the motion was easy enough. I called out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no purpose. I looked towards my windows, and could see nothing but the clouds and sky. I heard a noise just over my head, like the clapping of wings, and then began to perceive the woful condition I was in; that some eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it fall on a rock, like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body, and devour it: for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to discover his quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I could be within a two-inch board.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000583\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000583\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000584\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000584\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In a little time, I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase very fast, and my box was tossed up and down, like a sign in a windy day. I heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought given to the eagle (for such I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his beak), and then, all on a sudden, felt myself falling perpendicularly down, for above a minute, but with such incredible swiftness, that I almost lost my breath. My fall was stopped by a terrible squash, that sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I was quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise so high, that I could see light from the tops of the windows. I now perceived I was fallen into the sea. My box, by the weight of my body, the goods that were in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength at the four corners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet deep in water. I did then, and do now suppose, that the eagle which flew away with my box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me drop, while he defended himself against the rest, who hoped to share in the prey. The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for those were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water. Every joint of it was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came in. I got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured to draw back the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on purpose to let in air, for want of which I found myself almost stifled.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000585\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000585\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000586\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000586\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>How often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom one single hour had so far divided me!

I now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling through the hole with a loud voice, in the English tongue, “If there be any body below, let them speak.” I answered, “I was an Englishman, drawn by ill fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent, and begged, by all that was moving, to be delivered out of the dungeon I was in.” The voice replied, “I was safe, for my box was fastened to their ship; and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the cover, large enough to pull me out.” I answered, “that was needless, and would take up too much time; for there was no more to be done, but let one of the crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out of the sea into the ship, and so into the captain’s cabin.” Some of them, upon hearing me talk so wildly, thought I was mad: others laughed; for indeed it never came into my head, that I was now got among people of my own stature and strength. The carpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a passage about four feet square, then let down a small ladder, upon which I mounted, and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000591\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000591\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000592\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000592\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions, which I had no inclination to answer. I was equally confounded at the sight of so many pigmies, for such I took them to be, after having so long accustomed my eyes to the monstrous objects I had left. But the captain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy Shropshire man, observing I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cordial to comfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising me to take a little rest, of which I had great need. Before I went to sleep, I gave him to understand that I had some valuable furniture in my box, too good to be lost: a fine hammock, a handsome field-bed, two chairs, a table, and a cabinet; that my closet was hung on all sides, or rather quilted, with silk and cotton; that if he would let one of the crew bring my closet into his cabin, I would open it there before him, and show him my goods. The captain, hearing me utter these absurdities, concluded I was raving; however (I suppose to pacify me) he promised to give order as I desired, and going upon deck, sent some of his men down into my closet, whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up all my goods, and stripped off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and bedstead, being screwed to the floor, were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen, who tore them up by force. Then they knocked off some of the boards for the use of the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for, let the hull drop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom and sides, sunk to rights. And, indeed, I was glad not to have been a spectator of the havoc they made, because I am confident it would have sensibly touched me, by bringing former passages into my mind, which I would rather have forgot.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000593\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000593\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000594\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000594\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place I had left, and the dangers I had escaped. However, upon waking, I found myself much recovered. It was now about eight o’clock at night, and the captain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already fasted too long. He entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look wildly, or talk inconsistently: and, when we were left alone, desired I would give him a relation of my travels, and by what accident I came to be set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest. He said “that about twelve o’clock at noon, as he was looking through his glass, he spied it at a distance, and thought it was a sail, which he had a mind to make, being not much out of his course, in hopes of buying some biscuit, his own beginning to fall short. That upon coming nearer, and finding his error, he sent out his long-boat to discover what it was; that his men came back in a fright, swearing they had seen a swimming house. That he laughed at their folly, and went himself in the boat, ordering his men to take a strong cable along with them. That the weather being calm, he rowed round me several times, observed my windows and wire lattices that defended them. That he discovered two staples upon one side, which was all of boards, without any passage for light. He then commanded his men to row up to that side, and fastening a cable to one of the staples, ordered them to tow my chest, as they called it, toward the ship. When it was there, he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring fixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest with pulleys, which all the sailors were not able to do above two or three feet.” He said, “they saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole, and concluded that some unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity.” I asked, “whether he or the crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air, about the time he first discovered me.” To which he answered, “that discoursing this matter with the sailors while I was asleep, one of them said, he had observed three eagles flying towards the north, but remarked nothing of their being larger than the usual size:” which I suppose must be imputed to the great height they were at; and he could not guess the reason of my question. I then asked the captain, “how far he reckoned we might be from land?” He said, “by the best computation he could make, we were at least a hundred leagues.” I assured him, “that he must be mistaken by almost half, for I had not left the country whence I came above two hours before I dropped into the sea.” Whereupon he began again to think that my brain was disturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed in a cabin he had provided. I assured him, “I was well refreshed with his good entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I was in my life.” He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely, “whether I were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime, for which I was punished, at the command of some prince, by exposing me in that chest; as great criminals, in other countries, have been forced to sea in a leaky vessel, without provisions: for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship, yet he would engage his word to set me safe ashore, in the first port where we arrived.” He added, “that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd speeches I had delivered at first to his sailors, and afterwards to himself, in relation to my closet or chest, as well as by my odd looks and behaviour while I was at supper.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000595\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000595\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000596\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000596\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully did, from the last time I left England, to the moment he first discovered me. And, as truth always forces its way into rational minds, so this honest worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very good sense, was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity. But further to confirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet should be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet. I opened it in his own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made in the country from which I had been so strangely delivered. There was the comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king’s beard, and another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty’s thumb-nail, which served for the back. There was a collection of needles and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like joiner’s tacks; some combings of the queen’s hair; a gold ring, which one day she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from her little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar. I desired the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his civilities; which he absolutely refused. I showed him a corn that I had cut off with my own hand, from a maid of honour’s toe; it was about the bigness of Kentish pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned to England, I got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver. Lastly, I desired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a mouse’s skin.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000597\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000597\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000598\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000598\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I could force nothing on him but a footman’s tooth, which I observed him to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it.

But, when I spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in the streets, to another looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when I was placed on a table, or held in any person’s hand.” I told him, “I had likewise observed another thing, that, when I first got into the ship, and the sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most little contemptible creatures I had ever beheld.” For indeed, while I was in that prince’s country, I could never endure to look in a glass, after my eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the comparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself. The captain said, “that while we were at supper, he observed me to look at every thing with a sort of wonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my laughter, which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some disorder in my brain.” I answered, “it was very true; and I wondered how I could forbear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a silver three-pence, a leg of pork hardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a nut-shell;” and so I went on, describing the rest of his household-stuff and provisions, after the same manner. For, although the queen had ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me, while I was in her service, yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every side of me, and I winked at my own littleness, as people do at their own faults. The captain understood my raillery very well, and merrily replied with the old English proverb, “that he doubted my eyes were bigger than my belly, for he did not observe my stomach so good, although I had fasted all day;” and, continuing in his mirth, protested “he would have gladly given a hundred pounds, to have seen my closet in the eagle’s bill, and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea; which would certainly have been a most astonishing object, worthy to have the description of it transmitted to future ages:” and the comparison of Phaeton was so obvious, that he could not forbear applying it, although I did not much admire the conceit.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000603\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000603\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000604\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000604\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England, driven north-eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143.

My men were sent by an equal division into both the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned. As to myself, it was determined that I should be set adrift in a small canoe, with paddles and a sail, and four days’ provisions; which last, the Japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores, and would permit no man to search me. I got down into the canoe, while the Dutchman, standing upon the deck, loaded me with all the curses and injurious terms his language could afford.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000633\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000633\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000634\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000634\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>About an hour before we saw the pirates I had taken an observation, and found we were in the latitude of 46 N. and longitude of 183.

I set up my sail, the wind being fair, with a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which I made a shift to do, in about three hours. It was all rocky: however I got many birds’ eggs; and, striking fire, I kindled some heath and dry sea-weed, by which I roasted my eggs.

I encompassed it almost round, before I could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek, about three times the wideness of my canoe. I found the island to be all rocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling herbs. I took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself, I secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were great numbers; I gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quantity of dry sea-weed, and parched grass, which I designed to kindle the next day, and roast my eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel, match, and burning-glass. I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged my provisions. My bed was the same dry grass and sea-weed which I intended for fuel. I slept very little, for the disquiets of my mind prevailed over my weariness, and kept me awake. I considered how impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place, and how miserable my end must be: yet found myself so listless and desponding, that I had not the heart to rise; and before I could get spirits enough to creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced. I walked awhile among the rocks: the sky was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was forced to turn my face from it: when all on a sudden it became obscure, as I thought, in a manner very different from what happens by the interposition of a cloud. I turned back, and perceived a vast opaque body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island: it seemed to be about two miles high, and hid the sun six or seven minutes; but I did not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than if I had stood under the shade of a mountain. As it approached nearer over the place where I was, it appeared to be a firm substance, the bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright, from the reflection of the sea below. I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore, and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me, at less than an English mile distance. I took out my pocket perspective, and could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of it, which appeared to be sloping; but what those people were doing I was not able to distinguish.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000639\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000639\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000640\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000640\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy, and I was ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, some way or other, help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was in.

But not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise upon this phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what course the island would take, because it seemed for a while to stand still. Yet soon after, it advanced nearer, and I could see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to descend from one to the other. In the lowest gallery, I beheld some people fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on. I waved my cap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the island; and upon its nearer approach, I called and shouted with the utmost strength of my voice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a crowd gather to that side which was most in my view. I found by their pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me, although they made no return to my shouting. But I could see four or five men running in great haste, up the stairs, to the top of the island, who then disappeared. I happened rightly to conjecture, that these were sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000641\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000641\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000642\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000642\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The number of people increased, and, in less than half an hour, the island was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest gallery appeared in a parallel of less than a hundred yards distance from the height where I stood.

They beheld me with all the marks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was I much in their debt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their shapes, habits, and countenances. Their heads were all reclined, either to the right, or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other directly up to the zenith. Their outward garments were adorned with the figures of suns, moons, and stars; interwoven with those of fiddles, flutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsichords, and many other instruments of music, unknown to us in Europe. I observed, here and there, many in the habit of servants, with a blown bladder, fastened like a flail to the end of a stick, which they carried in their hands. In each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas, or little pebbles, as I was afterwards informed. With these bladders, they now and then flapped the mouths and ears of those who stood near them, of which practice I could not then conceive the meaning. It seems the minds of these people are so taken up with intense speculations, that they neither can speak, nor attend to the discourses of others, without being roused by some external taction upon the organs of speech and hearing; for which reason, those persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper (the original is <i>climenole</i>) in their family, as one of their domestics; nor ever walk abroad, or make visits, without him.

Before the throne, was a large table filled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all kinds. His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our entrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all persons belonging to the court. But he was then deep in a problem; and we attended at least an hour, before he could solve it. There stood by him, on each side, a young page with flaps in their hands, and when they saw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and the other his right ear; at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden, and looking towards me and the company I was in, recollected the occasion of our coming, whereof he had been informed before. He spoke some words, whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and flapped me gently on the right ear; but I made signs, as well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an instrument; which, as I afterwards found, gave his majesty, and the whole court, a very mean opinion of my understanding. The king, as far as I could conjecture, asked me several questions, and I addressed myself to him in all the languages I had. When it was found I could neither understand nor be understood, I was conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace (this prince being distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to strangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me. My dinner was brought, and four persons of quality, whom I remembered to have seen very near the king’s person, did me the honour to dine with me. We had two courses, of three dishes each. In the first course, there was a shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into a rhomboides, and a pudding into a cycloid. The second course was two ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling flutes and hautboys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp. The servants cut our bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several other mathematical figures.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000656\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000656\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000657\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000657\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>While we were at dinner, I made bold to ask the names of several things in their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their flappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of their great abilities if I could be brought to converse with them.

He brought with him pen, ink, and paper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that he was sent to teach me the language. We sat together four hours, in which time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the translations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several short sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or walk, and the like. Then I took down the sentence in writing. He showed me also, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the zodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the denominations of many planes and solids. He gave me the names and descriptions of all the musical instruments, and the general terms of art in playing on each of them. After he had left me, I placed all my words, with their interpretations, in alphabetical order. And thus, in a few days, by the help of a very faithful memory, I got some insight into their language. The word, which I interpret the flying or floating island, is in the original <i>Laputa</i>, whereof I could never learn the true etymology. <i>Lap</i>, in the old obsolete language, signifies high; and <i>untuh</i>, a governor; from which they say, by corruption, was derived <i>Laputa</i>, from <i>Lapuntuh</i>. But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a little strained. I ventured to offer to the learned among them a conjecture of my own, that Laputa was <i>quasi lap outed</i>; <i>lap</i>, signifying properly, the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and <i>outed</i>, a wing; which, however, I shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious reader.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000660\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000660\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000661\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000661\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Those to whom the king had entrusted me, observing how ill I was clad, ordered a tailor to come next morning, and take measure for a suit of clothes.

Their apprehensions arise from several changes they dread in the celestial bodies: for instance, that the earth, by the continual approaches of the sun towards it, must, in course of time, be absorbed, or swallowed up; that the face of the sun, will, by degrees, be encrusted with its own effluvia, and give no more light to the world; that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the tail of the last comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes; and that the next, which they have calculated for one-and-thirty years hence, will probably destroy us. For if, in its perihelion, it should approach within a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations they have reason to dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron, and in its absence from the sun, carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long, through which, if the earth should pass at the distance of one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus, or main body of the comet, it must in its passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes: that the sun, daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will at last be wholly consumed and annihilated; which must be attended with the destruction of this earth, and of all the planets that receive their light from it.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000674\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000674\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000675\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000675\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>They are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these, and the like impending dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly in their beds, nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements of life.

Upon the top of each tower, as well as upon the rock, they fixed a great loadstone, and in case their design should fail, they had provided a vast quantity of the most combustible fuel, hoping to burst therewith the adamantine bottom of the island, if the loadstone project should miscarry.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000717\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000717\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000718\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000718\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was eight months before the king had perfect notice that the Lindalinians were in rebellion.

This was accordingly done; but the officers employed in that work found the descent much speedier than usual, and by turning the loadstone could not without great difficulty keep it in a firm position, but found the island inclining to fall. They sent the king immediate intelligence of this astonishing event, and begged his majesty’s permission to raise the island higher; the king consented, a general council was called, and the officers of the loadstone ordered to attend. One of the oldest and expertest among them obtained leave to try an experiment, he took a strong line of an hundred yards, and the island being raised over the town above the attracting power they had felt, he fastened a piece of adamant to the end of his line, which had in it a mixture of iron mineral, of the same nature with that whereof the bottom or lower surface of the island is composed, and from the lower gallery let it down slowly towards the top of the towers. The adamant was not descended four yards, before the officer felt it drawn so strongly downwards that he could hardly pull it back, he then threw down several small pieces of adamant, and observed that they were all violently attracted by the top of the tower. The same experiment was made on the other three towers, and on the rock with the same effect.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000721\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000721\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000722\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000722\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This incident broke entirely the king’s measures, and (to dwell no longer on other circumstances) he was forced to give the town their own conditions.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000723\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000723\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000724\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000724\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I was assured by a great minister that if the island had descended so near the town as not to be able to raise itself, the citizens were determined to fix it for ever, to kill the king and all his servants, and entirely change the government.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000725\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000725\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000726\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000726\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>By a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either of his two eldest sons, are permitted to leave the island;

To this end, they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in Lagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people, that there is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy. In these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of agriculture and building, and new instruments, and tools for all trades and manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work of ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to last for ever without repairing. All the fruits of the earth shall come to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a hundred fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy proposals.

After salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of the room, he said, “Perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a project for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical operations. But the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness; and he flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted thought never sprang in any other man’s head. Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.” He then led me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in ranks. It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room. The superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but some larger than others. They were all linked together by slender wires. These bits of wood were covered, on every square, with paper pasted on them; and on these papers were written all the words of their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but without any order. The professor then desired me “to observe; for he was going to set his engine at work.” The pupils, at his command, took each of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed.

For it is plain, that every word we speak is, in some degree, a diminution of our lungs by corrosion, and, consequently, contributes to the shortening of our lives. An expedient was therefore offered, “that since words are only names for <i>things</i>, it would be more convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary to express a particular business they are to discourse on.” And this invention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as health of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and illiterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of their forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people. However, many of the most learned and wise adhere to the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this inconvenience attending it, that if a man’s business be very great, and of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong servants to attend him. I have often beheld two of those sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when they met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and hold conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements, help each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000811\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000811\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000812\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000812\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets, and under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot be at a loss.

There was a most ingenious doctor, who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature and system of government. This illustrious person had very usefully employed his studies, in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are subject, by the vices or infirmities of those who govern, as well as by the licentiousness of those who are to obey. For instance: whereas all writers and reasoners have agreed, that there is a strict universal resemblance between the natural and the political body; can there be any thing more evident, than that the health of both must be preserved, and the diseases cured, by the same prescriptions? It is allowed, that senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient, and other peccant humours; with many diseases of the head, and more of the heart; with strong convulsions, with grievous contractions of the nerves and sinews in both hands, but especially the right; with spleen, flatus, vertigos, and deliriums; with scrofulous tumours, full of fetid purulent matter; with sour frothy ructations: with canine appetites, and crudeness of digestion, besides many others, needless to mention. This doctor therefore proposed, “that upon the meeting of the senate, certain physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting, and at the close of each day’s debate feel the pulses of every senator; after which, having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the several maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth day return to the senate house, attended by their apothecaries stored with proper medicines; and before the members sat, administer to each of them lenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives, restringents, palliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics, apophlegmatics, acoustics, as their several cases required; and, according as these medicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit them, at the next meeting.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000826\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000826\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000827\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000827\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This project could not be of any great expense to the public;

Let the occiputs, thus cut off, be interchanged, applying each to the head of his opposite party-man.

Wit, valour, and politeness, were likewise proposed to be largely taxed, and collected in the same manner, by every person’s giving his own word for the quantum of what he possessed.

We passed through several apartments, between servants of the same sort, ranked on each side as before, till we came to the chamber of presence; where, after three profound obeisances, and a few general questions, we were permitted to sit on three stools, near the lowest step of his highness’s throne. He understood the language of Balnibarbi, although it was different from that of this island. He desired me to give him some account of my travels; and, to let me see that I should be treated without ceremony, he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his finger; at which, to my great astonishment, they vanished in an instant, like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden. I could not recover myself in some time, till the governor assured me, “that I should receive no hurt;” and observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had been often entertained in the same manner, I began to take courage, and related to his highness a short history of my several adventures; yet not without some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place where I had seen those domestic spectres. I had the honour to dine with the governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at table. I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in the morning. I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to excuse me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace. My two friends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the capital of this little island; and the next morning we returned to pay our duty to the governor, as he was pleased to command us.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000867\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000867\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000868\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000868\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part of every day with the governor, and at night in our lodging.

I proposed that Homer and Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these were so numerous, that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court, and outward rooms of the palace. I knew, and could distinguish those two heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other. Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever beheld. Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff. His visage was meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow. I soon discovered that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and had never seen or heard of them before; and I had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless, “that these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity.” I introduced Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a poet. But Aristotle was out of all patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented them to him; and he asked them, “whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as themselves?”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000886\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000886\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000887\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000887\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with whom I prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle.

In another, a barber, an abbot, and two cardinals. I have too great a veneration for crowned heads, to dwell any longer on so nice a subject. But as to counts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was not so scrupulous. And I confess, it was not without some pleasure, that I found myself able to trace the particular features, by which certain families are distinguished, up to their originals. I could plainly discover whence one family derives a long chin; why a second has abounded with knaves for two generations, and fools for two more; why a third happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers; whence it came, what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great house, <i>Nec vir fortis</i>, <i>nec femina casta</i>; how cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice, grew to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much as by their coats of arms; who first brought the pox into a noble house, which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity.

He told me, “he had for many years been commander of a ship; and in the sea fight at Actium had the good fortune to break through the enemy’s great line of battle, sink three of their capital ships, and take a fourth, which was the sole cause of Antony’s flight, and of the victory that ensued; that the youth standing by him, his only son, was killed in the action.” He added, “that upon the confidence of some merit, the war being at an end, he went to Rome, and solicited at the court of Augustus to be preferred to a greater ship, whose commander had been killed; but, without any regard to his pretensions, it was given to a boy who had never seen the sea, the son of Libertina, who waited on one of the emperor’s mistresses. Returning back to his own vessel, he was charged with neglect of duty, and the ship given to a favourite page of Publicola, the vice-admiral; whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a great distance from Rome, and there ended his life.” I was so curious to know the truth of this story, that I desired Agrippa might be called, who was admiral in that fight.

It contained a warrant for conducting me and my retinue to <i>Traldragdubh</i>, or <i>Trildrogdrib</i> (for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can remember), by a party of ten horse. All my retinue was that poor lad for an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble request, we had each of us a mule to ride on. A messenger was despatched half a day’s journey before us, to give the king notice of my approach, and to desire, “that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour, when it would by his gracious pleasure that I might have the honour to lick the dust before his footstool.” This is the court style, and I found it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my admittance two days after my arrival, I was commanded to crawl upon my belly, and lick the floor as I advanced; but, on account of my being a stranger, care was taken to have it made so clean, that the dust was not offensive. However, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any but persons of the highest rank, when they desire an admittance. Nay, sometimes the floor is strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to be admitted happens to have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen a great lord with his mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper distance from the throne; he was not able to speak a word. Neither is there any remedy; because it is capital for those, who receive an audience to spit or wipe their mouths in his majesty’s presence. There is indeed another custom, which I cannot altogether approve of: when the king has a mind to put any of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition, which being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours. But in justice to this prince’s great clemency, and the care he has of his subjects’ lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of Europe would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his honour, that strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well washed after every such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure. I myself heard him give directions, that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution, but maliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a young lord of great hopes, coming to an audience, was unfortunately poisoned, although the king at that time had no design against his life. But this good prince was so gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping, upon promise that he would do so no more, without special orders.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000921\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000921\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000922\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000922\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>To return from this digression.

He said, “they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty years old; after which, by degrees, they grew melancholy and dejected, increasing in both till they came to fourscore. This he learned from their own confession: for otherwise, there not being above two or three of that species born in an age, they were too few to form a general observation by. When they came to fourscore years, which is reckoned the extremity of living in this country, they had not only all the follies and infirmities of other old men, but many more which arose from the dreadful prospect of never dying. They were not only opinionative, peevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable of friendship, and dead to all natural affection, which never descended below their grandchildren. Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions. But those objects against which their envy seems principally directed, are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old. By reflecting on the former, they find themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral, they lament and repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they themselves never can hope to arrive. They have no remembrance of anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and middle-age, and even that is very imperfect; and for the truth or particulars of any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than upon their best recollections. The least miserable among them appear to be those who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet with more pity and assistance, because they want many bad qualities which abound in others.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000958\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000958\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000959\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000959\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“If a <i>struldbrug</i> happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage is dissolved of course, by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as the younger of the two comes to be fourscore; for the law thinks it a reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned, without any fault of their own, to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their misery doubled by the load of a wife.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000960\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000960\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000961\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000961\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“As soon as they have completed the term of eighty years, they are looked on as dead in law; their heirs immediately succeed to their estates; only a small pittance is reserved for their support; and the poor ones are maintained at the public charge.

This prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct me to Glanguenstald, which is a royal port to the south-west part of the island. In six days I found a vessel ready to carry me to Japan, and spent fifteen days in the voyage. We landed at a small port-town called Xamoschi, situated on the south-east part of Japan; the town lies on the western point, where there is a narrow strait leading northward into a long arm of the sea, upon the north-west part of which, Yedo, the metropolis, stands. At landing, I showed the custom-house officers my letter from the king of Luggnagg to his imperial majesty. They knew the seal perfectly well; it was as broad as the palm of my hand. The impression was, <i>A king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth</i>. The magistrates of the town, hearing of my letter, received me as a public minister. They provided me with carriages and servants, and bore my charges to Yedo; where I was admitted to an audience, and delivered my letter, which was opened with great ceremony, and explained to the Emperor by an interpreter, who then gave me notice, by his majesty’s order, “that I should signify my request, and, whatever it were, it should be granted, for the sake of his royal brother of Luggnagg.” This interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the Hollanders. He soon conjectured, by my countenance, that I was a European, and therefore repeated his majesty’s commands in Low Dutch, which he spoke perfectly well. I answered, as I had before determined, “that I was a Dutch merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote country, whence I had travelled by sea and land to Luggnagg, and then took shipping for Japan; where I knew my countrymen often traded, and with some of these I hoped to get an opportunity of returning into Europe: I therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour, to give order that I should be conducted in safety to Nangasac.” To this I added another petition, “that for the sake of my patron the king of Luggnagg, his majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on my countrymen, of trampling upon the crucifix, because I had been thrown into his kingdom by my misfortunes, without any intention of trading.” When this latter petition was interpreted to the Emperor, he seemed a little surprised; and said, “he believed I was the first of my countrymen who ever made any scruple in this point; and that he began to doubt, whether I was a real Hollander, or not; but rather suspected I must be a Christian. However, for the reasons I had offered, but chiefly to gratify the king of Luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour, he would comply with the singularity of my humour; but the affair must be managed with dexterity, and his officers should be commanded to let me pass, as it were by forgetfulness. For he assured me, that if the secret should be discovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they would cut my throat in the voyage.” I returned my thanks, by the interpreter, for so unusual a favour; and some troops being at that time on their march to Nangasac, the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither, with particular instructions about the business of the crucifix.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000989\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000989\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000990\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000990\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>On the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long and troublesome journey. I soon fell into the company of some Dutch sailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons. I had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I spoke Dutch well. The seamen soon knew from whence I came last: they were curious to inquire into my voyages and course of life. I made up a story as short and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part. I knew many persons in Holland. I was able to invent names for my parents, whom I pretended to be obscure people in the province of Gelderland. I would have given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask for my voyage to Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was contented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve him in the way of my calling. Before we took shipping, I was often asked by some of the crew, whether I had performed the ceremony above mentioned. I evaded the question by general answers; “that I had satisfied the Emperor and court in all particulars.” However, a malicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer, and pointing to me, told him, “I had not yet trampled on the crucifix;” but the other, who had received instructions to let me pass, gave the rascal twenty strokes on the shoulders with a bamboo; after which I was no more troubled with such questions.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000991\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000991\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000992\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000000992\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Nothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage.

When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the country, resolving to deliver myself to the first savages I should meet, and purchase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other toys, which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages, and whereof I had some about me. The land was divided by long rows of trees, not regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was great plenty of grass, and several fields of oats. I walked very circumspectly, for fear of being surprised, or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind, or on either side. I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracts of human feet, and some of cows, but most of horses. At last I beheld several animals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees. Their shape was very singular and deformed, which a little discomposed me, so that I lay down behind a thicket to observe them better. Some of them coming forward near the place where I lay, gave me an opportunity of distinctly marking their form. Their heads and breasts were covered with a thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank; they had beards like goats, and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the fore parts of their legs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might see their skins, which were of a brown buff colour. They had no tails, nor any hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus, which, I presume, nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the ground, for this posture they used, as well as lying down, and often stood on their hind feet. They climbed high trees as nimbly as a squirrel, for they had strong extended claws before and behind, terminating in sharp points, and hooked. They would often spring, and bound, and leap, with prodigious agility. The females were not so large as the males; they had long lank hair on their heads, but none on their faces, nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their bodies, except about the anus and pudenda. The dugs hung between their forefeet, and often reached almost to the ground as they walked. The hair of both sexes was of several colours, brown, red, black, and yellow. Upon the whole, I never beheld, in all my travels, so disagreeable an animal, or one against which I naturally conceived so strong an antipathy. So that, thinking I had seen enough, full of contempt and aversion, I got up, and pursued the beaten road, hoping it might direct me to the cabin of some Indian. I had not got far, when I met one of these creatures full in my way, and coming up directly to me. The ugly monster, when he saw me, distorted several ways, every feature of his visage, and stared, as at an object he had never seen before; then approaching nearer, lifted up his fore-paw, whether out of curiosity or mischief I could not tell; but I drew my hanger, and gave him a good blow with the flat side of it, for I durst not strike with the edge, fearing the inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they should come to know that I had killed or maimed any of their cattle. When the beast felt the smart, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty came flocking about me from the next field, howling and making odious faces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it, kept them off by waving my hanger. Several of this cursed brood, getting hold of the branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence they began to discharge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with the filth, which fell about me on every side.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001011\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001011\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001012\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001012\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away on a sudden as fast as they could; at which I ventured to leave the tree and pursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into this fright. But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly in the field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of their flight. The horse started a little, when he came near me, but soon recovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of wonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times. I would have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the way, yet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least violence. We stood gazing at each other for some time; at last I took the boldness to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it, using the common style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going to handle a strange horse. But this animal seemed to receive my civilities with disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows, softly raising up his right fore-foot to remove my hand. Then he neighed three or four times, but in so different a cadence, that I almost began to think he was speaking to himself, in some language of his own.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001013\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001013\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001014\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001014\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>While he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying himself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each other’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying the sound, which seemed to be almost articulate.

I rubbed my eyes often, but the same objects still occurred. I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself, hoping I might be in a dream. I then absolutely concluded, that all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic. But I had no time to pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to the door, and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where I saw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their haunches upon mats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and clean.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001032\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001032\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001033\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001033\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up close, after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most contemptuous look; and turning to the horse, I heard the word <i>Yahoo</i> often repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could not then comprehend, although it was the first I had learned to pronounce. But I was soon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the horse, beckoning to me with his head, and repeating the <i>hhuun</i>, <i>hhuun</i>, as he did upon the road, which I understood was to attend him, led me out into a kind of court, where was another building, at some distance from the house.

My horror and astonishment are not to be described, when I observed in this abominable animal, a perfect human figure: the face of it indeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed, the lips large, and the mouth wide; but these differences are common to all savage nations, where the lineaments of the countenance are distorted, by the natives suffering their infants to lie grovelling on the earth, or by carrying them on their backs, nuzzling with their face against the mothers’ shoulders. The forefeet of the <i>Yahoo</i> differed from my hands in nothing else but the length of the nails, the coarseness and brownness of the palms, and the hairiness on the backs. There was the same resemblance between our feet, with the same differences; which I knew very well, though the horses did not, because of my shoes and stockings; the same in every part of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour, which I have already described.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001036\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001036\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001037\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001037\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see the rest of my body so very different from that of a <i>Yahoo</i>, for which I was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception. The sorrel nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we shall describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; I took it in my hand, and, having smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly as I could. He brought out of the <i>Yahoos</i>’ kennel a piece of ass’s flesh; but it smelt so offensively that I turned from it with loathing: he then threw it to the <i>Yahoo</i>, by whom it was greedily devoured. He afterwards showed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of oats; but I shook my head, to signify that neither of these were food for me. And indeed I now apprehended that I must absolutely starve, if I did not get to some of my own species; for as to those filthy <i>Yahoos</i>, although there were few greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself, yet I confess I never saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts; and the more I came near them the more hateful they grew, while I stayed in that country. This the master horse observed by my behaviour, and therefore sent the <i>Yahoo</i> back to his kennel. He then put his fore-hoof to his mouth, at which I was much surprised, although he did it with ease, and with a motion that appeared perfectly natural, and made other signs, to know what I would eat; but I could not return him such an answer as he was able to apprehend; and if he had understood me, I did not see how it was possible to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment. While we were thus engaged, I observed a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed to her, and expressed a desire to go and milk her. This had its effect; for he led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a room, where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels, after a very orderly and cleanly manner. She gave me a large bowlful, of which I drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001038\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001038\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001039\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001039\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>About noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a sledge by four <i>Yahoos</i>.

In the middle was a large rack, with angles answering to every partition of the manger; so that each horse and mare ate their own hay, and their own mash of oats and milk, with much decency and regularity. The behaviour of the young colt and foal appeared very modest, and that of the master and mistress extremely cheerful and complaisant to their guest.

Oats in their tongue are called <i>hlunnh</i>. This word I pronounced two or three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet, upon second thoughts, I considered that I could contrive to make of them a kind of bread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive, till I could make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of my own species. The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray. These I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed them till the husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the grain. I ground and beat them between two stones; then took water, and made them into a paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire and eat warm with milk. It was at first a very insipid diet, though common enough in many parts of Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having been often reduced to hard fare in my life, this was not the first experiment I had made how easily nature is satisfied. And I cannot but observe, that I never had one hour’s sickness while I stayed in this island. It is true, I sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit, or bird, by springs made of <i>Yahoo’s</i> hairs; and I often gathered wholesome herbs, which I boiled, and ate as salads with my bread; and now and then, for a rarity, I made a little butter, and drank the whey. I was at first at a great loss for salt, but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it; and I am confident that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury, and was first introduced only as a provocative to drink, except where it is necessary for preserving flesh in long voyages, or in places remote from great markets; for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man, and as to myself, when I left this country, it was a great while before I could endure the taste of it in anything that I ate.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001044\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001044\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001045\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001045\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other travellers fill their books, as if the readers were personally concerned whether we fare well or ill.

When I asserted that the <i>Yahoos</i> were the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was altogether past his conception, he desired to know, “whether we had <i>Houyhnhnms</i> among us, and what was their employment?” I told him, “we had great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in winter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where <i>Yahoo</i> servants were employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet, serve them with food, and make their beds.” “I understand you well,” said my master: “it is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that whatever share of reason the <i>Yahoos</i> pretend to, the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> are your masters; I heartily wish our <i>Yahoos</i> would be so tractable.” I begged “his honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further, because I was very certain that the account he expected from me would be highly displeasing.” But he insisted in commanding me to let him know the best and the worst. I told him “he should be obeyed.” I owned “that the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> among us, whom we called horses, were the most generous and comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swiftness; and when they belonged to persons of quality, were employed in travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery till they died; after which their skins were stripped, and sold for what they were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey. But the common race of horses had not so good fortune, being kept by farmers and carriers, and other mean people, who put them to greater labour, and fed them worse.” I described, as well as I could, our way of riding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of harness and wheels. I added, “that we fastened plates of a certain hard substance, called iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their hoofs from being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001090\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001090\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001091\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001091\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>My master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered “how we dared to venture upon a <i>Houyhnhnm’s</i> back; for he was sure, that the weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest <i>Yahoo</i>; or by lying down and rolling on his back, squeeze the brute to death.” I answered “that our horses were trained up, from three or four years old, to the several uses we intended them for; that if any of them proved intolerably vicious, they were employed for carriages; that they were severely beaten, while they were young, for any mischievous tricks; that the males, designed for the common use of riding or draught, were generally castrated about two years after their birth, to take down their spirits, and make them more tame and gentle; that they were indeed sensible of rewards and punishments; but his honour would please to consider, that they had not the least tincture of reason, any more than the <i>Yahoos</i> in this country.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001092\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001092\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001093\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001093\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a right idea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in variety of words, because their wants and passions are fewer than among us. But it is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of the <i>Houyhnhnm</i> race; particularly after I had explained the manner and use of castrating horses among us, to hinder them from propagating their kind, and to render them more servile. He said, “if it were possible there could be any country where <i>Yahoos</i> alone were endued with reason, they certainly must be the governing animal; because reason in time will always prevail against brutal strength. But, considering the frame of our bodies, and especially of mine, he thought no creature of equal bulk was so ill-contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of life;” whereupon he desired to know “whether those among whom I lived resembled me, or the <i>Yahoos</i> of his country?” I assured him, “that I was as well shaped as most of my age; but the younger, and the females, were much more soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as white as milk.” He said, “I differed indeed from other <i>Yahoos</i>, being much more cleanly, and not altogether so deformed; but, in point of real advantage, he thought I differed for the worse: that my nails were of no use either to my fore or hinder feet; as to my forefeet, he could not properly call them by that name, for he never observed me to walk upon them; that they were too soft to bear the ground; that I generally went with them uncovered; neither was the covering I sometimes wore on them of the same shape, or so strong as that on my feet behind: that I could not walk with any security, for if either of my hinder feet slipped, I must inevitably fall.” He then began to find fault with other parts of my body: “the flatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, my eyes placed directly in front, so that I could not look on either side without turning my head: that I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one of my forefeet to my mouth: and therefore nature had placed those joints to answer that necessity. He knew not what could be the use of those several clefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering made from the skin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a fence against heat and cold, which I was forced to put on and off every day, with tediousness and trouble: and lastly, that he observed every animal in this country naturally to abhor the <i>Yahoos</i>, whom the weaker avoided, and the stronger drove from them. So that, supposing us to have the gift of reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural antipathy, which every creature discovered against us; nor consequently how we could tame and render them serviceable. However, he would,” as he said, “debate the matter no farther, because he was more desirous to know my own story, the country where I was born, and the several actions and events of my life, before I came hither.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001094\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001094\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001095\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001095\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I assured him, “how extremely desirous I was that he should be satisfied on every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be possible for me to explain myself on several subjects, whereof his honour could have no conception; because I saw nothing in his country to which I could resemble them; that, however, I would do my best, and strive to express myself by similitudes, humbly desiring his assistance when I wanted proper words;” which he was pleased to promise me.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001096\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001096\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001097\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001097\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I said, “my birth was of honest parents, in an island called England; which was remote from his country, as many days’ journey as the strongest of his honour’s servants could travel in the annual course of the sun; that I was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in the body, gotten by accident or violence; that my country was governed by a female man, whom we called queen; that I left it to get riches, whereby I might maintain myself and family, when I should return; that, in my last voyage, I was commander of the ship, and had about fifty <i>Yahoos</i> under me, many of which died at sea, and I was forced to supply them by others picked out from several nations; that our ship was twice in danger of being sunk, the first time by a great storm, and the second by striking against a rock.” Here my master interposed, by asking me, “how I could persuade strangers, out of different countries, to venture with me, after the losses I had sustained, and the hazards I had run?” I said, “they were fellows of desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes.

To clear up which, I endeavoured to give some ideas of the desire of power and riches; of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and envy. All this I was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making suppositions. After which, like one whose imagination was struck with something never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes with amazement and indignation. Power, government, war, law, punishment, and a thousand other things, had no terms wherein that language could express them, which made the difficulty almost insuperable, to give my master any conception of what I meant. But being of an excellent understanding, much improved by contemplation and converse, he at last arrived at a competent knowledge of what human nature, in our parts of the world, is capable to perform, and desired I would give him some particular account of that land which we call Europe, but especially of my own country.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001100\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001100\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001101\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001101\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001102\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001102\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3>CHAPTER V.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001103\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001103\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001104\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001104\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"letter\\\">The author at his master’s command, informs him of the state of England.

Neither are any wars so furious and bloody, or of so long a continuance, as those occasioned by difference in opinion, especially if it be in things indifferent.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001111\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001111\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001112\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001112\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them shall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them pretend to any right. Sometimes one prince quarrels with another for fear the other should quarrel with him. Sometimes a war is entered upon, because the enemy is too strong; and sometimes, because he is too weak. Sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have the things which we want, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us theirs. It is a very justifiable cause of a war, to invade a country after the people have been wasted by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or embroiled by factions among themselves. It is justifiable to enter into war against our nearest ally, when one of his towns lies convenient for us, or a territory of land, that would render our dominions round and complete. If a prince sends forces into a nation, where the people are poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to death, and make slaves of the rest, in order to civilize and reduce them from their barbarous way of living. It is a very kingly, honourable, and frequent practice, when one prince desires the assistance of another, to secure him against an invasion, that the assistant, when he has driven out the invader, should seize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or banish, the prince he came to relieve. Alliance by blood, or marriage, is a frequent cause of war between princes; and the nearer the kindred is, the greater their disposition to quarrel; poor nations are hungry, and rich nations are proud; and pride and hunger will ever be at variance. For these reasons, the trade of a soldier is held the most honourable of all others; because a soldier is a <i>Yahoo</i> hired to kill, in cold blood, as many of his own species, who have never offended him, as possibly he can.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001113\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001113\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001114\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001114\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“There is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in Europe, not able to make war by themselves, who hire out their troops to richer nations, for so much a day to each man; of which they keep three-fourths to themselves, and it is the best part of their maintenance: such are those in many northern parts of Europe.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001115\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001115\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001116\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001116\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“What you have told me,” said my master, “upon the subject of war, does indeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend to: however, it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger; and that nature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief.

To this society all the rest of the people are slaves. For example, if my neighbour has a mind to my cow, he has a lawyer to prove that he ought to have my cow from me. I must then hire another to defend my right, it being against all rules of law that any man should be allowed to speak for himself. Now, in this case, I, who am the right owner, lie under two great disadvantages: first, my lawyer, being practised almost from his cradle in defending falsehood, is quite out of his element when he would be an advocate for justice, which is an unnatural office he always attempts with great awkwardness, if not with ill-will. The second disadvantage is, that my lawyer must proceed with great caution, or else he will be reprimanded by the judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that would lessen the practice of the law. And therefore I have but two methods to preserve my cow. The first is, to gain over my adversary’s lawyer with a double fee, who will then betray his client by insinuating that he hath justice on his side. The second way is for my lawyer to make my cause appear as unjust as he can, by allowing the cow to belong to my adversary: and this, if it be skilfully done, will certainly bespeak the favour of the bench. Now your honour is to know, that these judges are persons appointed to decide all controversies of property, as well as for the trial of criminals, and picked out from the most dexterous lawyers, who are grown old or lazy; and having been biassed all their lives against truth and equity, lie under such a fatal necessity of favouring fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have known some of them refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than injure the faculty, by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or their office.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001127\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001127\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001128\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001128\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>“It is a maxim among these lawyers that whatever has been done before, may legally be done again: and therefore they take special care to record all the decisions formerly made against common justice, and the general reason of mankind.

Therefore he desired I would let him know, “what these costly meats were, and how any of us happened to want them?” Whereupon I enumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with the various methods of dressing them, which could not be done without sending vessels by sea to every part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for sauces and innumerable other conveniences. I assured him “that this whole globe of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better female <i>Yahoos</i> could get her breakfast, or a cup to put it in.” He said “that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its own inhabitants. But what he chiefly wondered at was, how such vast tracts of ground as I described should be wholly without fresh water, and the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink.” I replied “that England (the dear place of my nativity) was computed to produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are able to consume, as well as liquors extracted from grain, or pressed out of the fruit of certain trees, which made excellent drink, and the same proportion in every other convenience of life. But, in order to feed the luxury and intemperance of the males, and the vanity of the females, we sent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other countries, whence, in return, we brought the materials of diseases, folly, and vice, to spend among ourselves.

The reason of this assertion was, that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful <i>Yahoo</i> (meaning myself) which most of them had heard of, and many of them had seen. He then related to them how he first found me; that my body was all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other animals; that I spoke in a language of my own, and had thoroughly learned theirs; that I had related to him the accidents which brought me thither; that when he saw me without my covering, I was an exact <i>Yahoo</i> in every part, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with shorter claws. He added, how I had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other countries, the <i>Yahoos</i> acted as the governing, rational animal, and held the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities of a <i>Yahoo</i>, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason, which, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the <i>Houyhnhnm</i> race, as the <i>Yahoos</i> of their country were to me; that, among other things, I mentioned a custom we had of castrating <i>Houyhnhnms</i> when they were young, in order to render them tame; that the operation was easy and safe; that it was no shame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is taught by the ant, and building by the swallow (for so I translate the word <i>lyhannh</i>, although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention might be practised upon the younger <i>Yahoos</i> here, which besides rendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end to the whole species, without destroying life; that in the mean time the <i>Houyhnhnms</i> should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which, as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this advantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the others are not till twelve.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001277\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001277\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001278\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001278\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This was all my master thought fit to tell me, at that time, of what passed in the grand council.

However, they have excellent medicines, composed of herbs, to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or frog of the foot, by sharp stones, as well as other maims and hurts in the several parts of the body.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001281\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001281\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001282\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001282\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>They calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon, but use no subdivisions into weeks.

I had beaten hemp, which there grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I filled with the feathers of several birds I had taken with springes made of <i>Yahoos’</i> hairs, and were excellent food. I had worked two chairs with my knife, the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part. When my clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called <i>nnuhnoh</i>, the skin of which is covered with a fine down. Of these I also made very tolerable stockings. I soled my shoes with wood, which I cut from a tree, and fitted to the upper-leather; and when this was worn out, I supplied it with the skins of <i>Yahoos</i> dried in the sun. I often got honey out of hollow trees, which I mingled with water, or ate with my bread. No man could more verify the truth of these two maxims, “That nature is very easily satisfied;” and, “That necessity is the mother of invention.” I enjoyed perfect health of body, and tranquillity of mind; I did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries of a secret or open enemy.

I never presumed to speak, except in answer to a question; and then I did it with inward regret, because it was a loss of so much time for improving myself; but I was infinitely delighted with the station of an humble auditor in such conversations, where nothing passed but what was useful, expressed in the fewest and most significant words; where, as I have already said, the greatest decency was observed, without the least degree of ceremony; where no person spoke without being pleased himself, and pleasing his companions; where there was no interruption, tediousness, heat, or difference of sentiments. They have a notion, that when people are met together, a short silence does much improve conversation: this I found to be true; for during those little intermissions of talk, new ideas would arise in their minds, which very much enlivened the discourse. Their subjects are, generally on friendship and benevolence, on order and economy; sometimes upon the visible operations of nature, or ancient traditions; upon the bounds and limits of virtue; upon the unerring rules of reason, or upon some determinations to be taken at the next great assembly: and often upon the various excellences of poetry. I may add, without vanity, that my presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse, because it afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of me and my country, upon which they were all pleased to descant, in a manner not very advantageous to humankind: and for that reason I shall not repeat what they said; only I may be allowed to observe, that his honour, to my great admiration, appeared to understand the nature of <i>Yahoos</i> much better than myself. He went through all our vices and follies, and discovered many, which I had never mentioned to him, by only supposing what qualities a <i>Yahoo</i> of their country, with a small proportion of reason, might be capable of exerting; and concluded, with too much probability, “how vile, as well as miserable, such a creature must be.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001304\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001304\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001305\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001305\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I freely confess, that all the little knowledge I have of any value, was acquired by the lectures I received from my master, and from hearing the discourses of him and his friends; to which I should be prouder to listen, than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in Europe.

The wind was full west, and by six in the evening I computed I had gone eastward at least eighteen leagues; when I spied a very small island about half a league off, which I soon reached. It was nothing but a rock, with one creek naturally arched by the force of tempests. Here I put in my canoe, and climbing a part of the rock, I could plainly discover land to the east, extending from south to north. I lay all night in my canoe; and repeating my voyage early in the morning, I arrived in seven hours to the south-east point of New Holland. This confirmed me in the opinion I have long entertained, that the maps and charts place this country at least three degrees more to the east than it really is; which thought I communicated many years ago to my worthy friend, Mr. Herman Moll, and gave him my reasons for it, although he has rather chosen to follow other authors.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001341\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001341\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001342\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001342\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed, I was afraid of venturing far into the country.

The <i>Lilliputians</i>, I think, are hardly worth the charge of a fleet and army to reduce them; and I question whether it might be prudent or safe to attempt the <i>Brobdingnagians</i>; or whether an English army would be much at their ease with the Flying Island over their heads. The <i>Houyhnhnms</i> indeed appear not to be so well prepared for war, a science to which they are perfect strangers, and especially against missive weapons. However, supposing myself to be a minister of state, I could never give my advice for invading them. Their prudence, unanimity, unacquaintedness with fear, and their love of their country, would amply supply all defects in the military art. Imagine twenty thousand of them breaking into the midst of an European army, confounding the ranks, overturning the carriages, battering the warriors’ faces into mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs. For they would well deserve the character given to Augustus, <i>Recalcitrat undique tutus</i>. But, instead of proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation, I rather wish they were in a capacity, or disposition, to send a sufficient number of their inhabitants for civilizing Europe, by teaching us the first principles of honour, justice, truth, temperance, public spirit, fortitude, chastity, friendship, benevolence, and fidelity. The names of all which virtues are still retained among us in most languages, and are to be met with in modern, as well as ancient authors; which I am able to assert from my own small reading.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001392\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001392\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001393\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/91087f822f8259a9/text/000001393\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6fc3a9 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-2ecd31 twpub-91087f822f8259a9-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But I had another reason, which made me less forward to enlarge his majesty’s dominions by my discoveries.
