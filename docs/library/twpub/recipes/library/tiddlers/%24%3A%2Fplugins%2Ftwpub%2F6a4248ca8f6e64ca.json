When it is cold, the sister's <i>haori</i>, or coat, serves as an extra covering for the baby as well; and when the sun is hot, the sister's parasol keeps off its rays from the bobbing bald head.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000701\\\">[*]</$link> Living in public, as the Japanese babies do, they soon acquire an intelligent, interested look, and seem to enjoy the games of the elder children, upon whose backs they are carried, as much as the players themselves. Babies of the middle classes do not live in public in this way, but ride about upon the backs of their nurses until they are old enough to toddle by themselves, and they are not so often seen in the streets; as few but the poorest Japanese, even in the large cities, are unable to have a pleasant bit of garden in which the children can play and take the air. The children of the richest families, the nobility, and the imperial family, are never carried about in this way. The young child is borne in the arms of an attendant, within doors and without; but as this requires the care of some one constantly, and prevents the nurse from doing anything but care for the child, only the richest can afford this luxury.

Imperial babies are held in the arms of some one night and day, from the moment of birth until they have learned to walk, a custom which seems to render the lot of the high-born infant less comfortable in some ways than that of the plebeian child.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000075\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000075\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The flexibility of the knees, which is required for comfort in the Japanese method of sitting, is gained in very early youth by the habit of setting a baby down with its knees bent under it, instead of with its legs out straight before it, as seems to us the natural way.

To a baby's delicate skin, the first bath or two is usually a severe trial, but it soon becomes accustomed to the high temperature, and takes its bath, as it does everything else, placidly and in public.

Another consequence, as I imagine, of the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> lack of proper food at the teething period, is the early loss of the child's first teeth, which usually turn black and decay some time before the second teeth begin to show themselves. With the exception of these two troubles, Japanese babies seem healthy, hearty, and happy to an extraordinary degree, and show that most of the conditions of their lives are wholesome. The constant out-of-door life and the healthful dress serve to make up in considerable measure for the poor food, and the Japanese baby, though small after the manner of the race, is usually plump, and of firm, hard flesh. One striking characteristic of the Japanese baby is, that at a very early age it learns to cling like a kitten to the back of whoever carries it, so that it is really difficult to drop it through carelessness, for the baby looks out for its own safety like a young monkey. The straps that tie it to the back are sufficient for safety; but the baby, from the age of one month, is dependent upon its own exertions to secure a comfortable position, and it soon learns to ride its bearer with considerable skill, instead of being merely a bundle tied to the shoulders. Any one<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> who has ever handled a Japanese baby can testify to the amount of intelligence shown in this direction at a very early age; and this clinging with arms and legs is, perhaps, a valuable part of the training which gives to the whole nation the peculiar quickness of motion and hardness of muscle that characterize them from childhood. It is the agility and muscular quality that belong to wild animals, that we see something of in the Indian, but to a more marked degree in the Japanese, especially of the lower classes.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000079\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000079\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The Japanese baby's first lessons in walking are taken under favorable circumstances. With feet comfortably shod in the soft <i>tabi</i>, or mitten-like sock, babies can tumble about as they like, with no bump nor bruise, upon the soft matted floors of the dwelling houses. There is no furniture to fall against, and nothing about the room to render falling a thing to be feared. After learning the art of walking in the house, the baby's first attempts out of doors are hampered by the <i>zori</i> or <i>géta</i>,—a light straw sandal or small wooden clog attached to the foot by a strap passing between the toes. At the very beginning the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> sandal or clog is tied to the baby's foot by bits of string fastened around the ankle, but this provision for security is soon discarded, and the baby patters along like the grown people, holding on the <i>géta</i> by the strap passing between the toes. This somewhat cumbersome and inconvenient foot gear must cause many falls at first, but baby's experience in the art of balancing upon people's backs now aids in this new art of balancing upon the little wooden clogs. Babies of two or three trot about quite comfortably in <i>géta</i> that seem to give most insecure footing, and older children run, jump, hop on one foot, and play all manner of active games upon heavy clogs that would wrench our ankles and toes out of all possibility of usefulness. This foot gear, while producing an awkward, shuffling gait, has certain advantages over our own, especially for children whose feet are growing rapidly. The <i>géta</i>, even if outgrown, can never cramp the toes nor compress the ankles. If the foot is too long for the clog the heel laps over behind, but the toes do not suffer, and the use of the <i>géta</i> strengthens the ankles by affording no artificial aid or support, and giving to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> all the muscles of foot and leg free play, with the foot in a natural position. The toes of the Japanese retain their prehensile qualities to a surprising degree, and are used, not only for grasping the foot gear, but among mechanics almost like two supplementary hands, to aid in holding the thing worked upon. Each toe knows its work and does it, and they are not reduced to the dull uniformity of motion that characterizes the toes of a leather-shod nation.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000080\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000080\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The distinction between the dress of the boy and the girl, that one notices from childhood, begins in babyhood.

The sex, even of a young baby, may be distinguished by the color of its clothing. White, the garb of mourning in Japan, is never used for children, but the minutest babies are dressed in bright-colored garments, and of the same materials—wadded cotton, silk, or crêpe—as those worn by adults of their social grade. As these<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> dresses are not as easily washed as our own cambric and flannel baby clothes, there is a loss among the poorer classes in the matter of cleanliness; and the gorgeous soiled gowns are not as attractive as the more washable white garments in which our babies are dressed.

A few simple words express much, and cover all wants. <i>Iya</i> expresses discontent or dislike of any kind, and is also used for &quot;no&quot;; <i>mam ma</i> means food; <i>bé bé</i> is the dress; <i>ta ta</i> is the sock, or house shoe, etc. We find many of the same sounds as in the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> baby language of English, with meanings totally different.

Her position will be an honorable and respected one only as she learns in her youth the lesson of cheerful obedience, of pleasing manners, and of personal cleanliness and neatness. Her duties must be always either within the house, or, if she belongs to the peasant class, on the farm. There is no career or vocation open to her: she must be dependent always upon either father, husband, or son, and her greatest happiness is to be gained, not by cultivation of the intellect, but by the early acquisition of the self-control <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>which is expected of all Japanese women to an even greater degree than of the men. This self-control must consist, not simply in the concealment of all the outward signs of any disagreeable emotion,—whether of grief, anger, or pain,—but in the assumption of a cheerful smile and agreeable manner under even the most distressing of circumstances. The duty of self-restraint is taught to the little girls of the family from the tenderest years; it is their great moral lesson, and is expatiated upon at all times by their elders. The little girl must sink herself entirely, must give up always to others, must never show emotions except such as will be pleasing to those about her: this is the secret of true politeness, and must be mastered if the woman wishes to be well thought of and to lead a happy life. The effect of this teaching is seen in the attractive but dignified manners of the Japanese women, and even of the very little girls. They are not forward nor pushing, neither are they awkwardly bashful; there is no self-consciousness, neither is there any lack of <i>savoir faire</i>; a childlike simplicity is united with a womanly consideration for the comfort of those around<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> them. A Japanese child seems to be the product of a more perfect civilization than our own, for it comes into the world with little of the savagery and barbarian bad manners that distinguish children in this country, and the first ten or fifteen years of its life do not seem to be passed in one long struggle to acquire a coating of good manners that will help to render it less obnoxious in polite society. How much of the politeness of the Japanese is the result of training, and how much is inherited from generations of civilized ancestors, it is difficult to tell; but my impression is, that babies are born into the world with a good start in the matter of manners, and that the uniformly gentle and courteous treatment that they receive from those about them, together with the continual verbal teaching of the principle of self-restraint and thoughtfulness of others, produce with very little difficulty the universally attractive manners of the people. One curious thing in a Japanese household is to see the formalities that pass between brothers and sisters, and the respect paid to age by every member of the family. The grandfather and grandmother come first of all in<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> everything,—no one at table must be helped before them in any case; after them come the father and mother; and lastly, the children according to their ages. A younger sister must always wait for the elder and pay her due respect, even in the matter of walking into the room before her. The wishes and convenience of the elder, rather than of the younger, are to be consulted in everything, and this lesson must be learned early by children. The difference in years may be slight, but the elder-born has the first right in all cases.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000083\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000083\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Our little girl's place in the family is a pleasant one: she is the pet and plaything of father and elder brothers, and she is never saluted by any one in the family, except her parents, without the title of respect due to her position.

As she passes from babyhood to girlhood, and from girlhood to womanhood, she is the object of much love and care and solicitude; but she does not grow up irresponsible or untrained to meet the duties which womanhood will surely bring to her. She must learn all the duties that fall upon the wife and mother of a Japanese household, as well as obtain the instruction in books and mathematics that is coming to be more and more a necessity for the women of Japan. She must take a certain responsibility in the household; must see that tea is made for the guests who may be received by her parents,—in all but the families of highest rank, must serve it herself. Indeed, it is quite the custom in families of the higher classes, should a guest, whom it is desired to receive with especial honor, dine at the house, to serve the meal, not with the family, but separately for the father and his visitor; and it is the duty of the wife or daughter, oftener the latter, to wait on them. This is in honor of the guest, not on account of the lack of servants, for there may be any number of them within call, or even in the back part of the room, ready<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> to receive from the hands of the young girl what she has removed. She must, therefore, know the proper etiquette of the table, how to serve carefully and neatly, and, above all, have the skill to ply the <i>saké</i> bottle, so that the house may keep up its reputation for hospitality. Should guests arrive in the absence of her parents, she must receive and entertain them until the master or mistress of the house returns. She also feels a certain care about the behavior of the younger members of the family, especially in the absence of the parents. In these various ways she is trained for taking upon herself the cares of a household when the time comes. In all but the very wealthiest and most aristocratic families, the daughters of the house do a large part of the simple housework. In a house with no furniture, no carpets, no bric-à-brac, no mirrors, picture frames or glasses to be cared for, no stoves or furnaces, no windows to wash, a large part of the cooking to be done outside, and no latest styles to be imitated in clothing, the amount of work to be done by women is considerably diminished, but still there remains enough to take a good deal of time.<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> Every morning there are the beds to be rolled up and stored away in the closet, the mosquito nets to be taken down, the rooms to be swept, dusted, and aired before breakfast. Besides this, there is the washing and polishing of the <i>engawa</i>, or piazza, which runs around the outside of a Japanese house between the <i>shoji</i>, or paper screens that serve as windows, and the <i>amado</i>, or sliding shutters, that are closed only at night, or during heavy, driving rains. Breakfast is to be cooked and served, dishes to be washed (in cold water); and then perhaps there is marketing to be done, either at shops outside or from the vendors of fish and vegetables who bring their huge baskets of provisions to the door; but after these duties are performed, it is possible to sit down quietly to the day's work of sewing, studying, or whatever else may suit the taste or necessities of the housewife. Of sewing there is always a good deal to be done, for many Japanese dresses must be taken to pieces whenever they are washed, and are turned, dyed, and made over again and again, so long as there is a shred of the original material left to work upon. There is washing, <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>too, to be done, although neither with hot water nor soap; and in the place of ironing, the cotton garments, which are usually washed without ripping, must be hung up on a bamboo pole passed through the armholes, and pulled smooth and straight before they dry; and the silk, always ripped into breadths before washing, must be smoothed while wet upon a board which is set in the sun until the silk is dry.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000084\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000084\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Then there are the every day dishes which our Japanese maiden must learn to prepare.

For about one week the festival lasts, and the festal spirit remains through the whole month, prompting to fun and amusements of all kinds. From early morning until bedtime the children wear their prettiest clothes, in which they play without rebuke. Guests come and go, bringing congratulations to the family, and often gifts for all.

One of the favorite games is &quot;<i>Hyaku nin isshu</i>,&quot; literally &quot;The poems of a hundred poets.&quot; It consists of two hundred cards, on each of which is printed either the first or last half of one of the hundred famous Japanese poems which give the name to the game. The poems are well known to all Japanese, of whatever sort or condition. All Japanese poems are short, containing only thirty-one syllables, and have a natural division into two parts. The one hundred cards containing the latter halves of the poems are dealt and laid out in rows, face upward, before the players. One person is appointed <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>reader. To him are given the remaining hundred cards, and he reads the beginnings of the poems in whatever order they come from the shuffled pack. Skill in the game consists in remembering quickly the line following the one read, and rapidly finding the card on which it is written. Especially does the player watch his own cards, and if he finds there the end of the poem, the beginning of which has just been read, he must pick it up before any one sees it and lay it aside. If some one else spies the card first, he seizes it and gives to the careless player several cards from his own hand. Whoever first disposes of all his cards is the winner. The players usually arrange themselves in two lines down the middle of the room, and the two sides play against each other, the game not being ended until either one side or the other has disposed of all its cards. The game requires great quickness of thought and of motion, and is invaluable in giving to all young people an education in the classical poetry of their own nation, as well as being a source of great merriment and jollity among young and old.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000088\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000088\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Scattered throughout the year are various <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>flower festivals, when, often with her whole family, our little girl visits the famous gardens where the plum, the cherry, the chrysanthemum, the iris, or the azalea attain their greatest loveliness, and spends the day out of doors in æsthetic enjoyment of the beauties of nature supplemented by art. And then there is the feast most loved in the whole year, the Feast of Dolls, when on the third day of the third month the great fire-proof storehouse gives forth its treasures of dolls,—in an old family, many of them hundreds of years old,—and for three days, with all their belongings of tiny furnishings in silver, lacquer, and porcelain, they reign supreme, arranged on red-covered shelves in the finest room of the house. Most prominent among the dolls are the effigies of the Emperor and Empress in antique court costume, seated in dignified calm, each on a lacquered dais. Near them are the figures of the five court musicians in their robes of office, each with his instrument. Beside these dolls, which are always present and form the central figures at the feast, numerous others, more plebeian, but more lovable, find places on the lower shelves,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> and the array of dolls' furnishings which is brought out on these occasions is something marvelous. It was my privilege to be present at the Feast of Dolls in the house of one of the <i>Tokugawa daimiōs</i>, a house in which the old forms and ceremonies were strictly observed, and over which the wave of foreign innovation had passed so slightly that even the calendar still remained unchanged, and the feast took place upon the third day of the third month of the old Japanese year, instead of on the third day of March, which is the usual time for it now. At this house, where the dolls had been accumulating for hundreds of years, five or six broad, red-covered shelves, perhaps twenty feet long or more, were completely filled with them and with their belongings. The Emperor and Empress appeared again and again, as well as the five court musicians, and the tiny furnishings and utensils were wonderfully costly and beautiful. Before each Emperor and Empress was set an elegant lacquered table service,—tray, bowls, cups, <i>saké</i> pots, rice buckets, etc., all complete; and in each utensil was placed the appropriate variety of food. The <i>saké</i> used on<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> this occasion is a sweet, white liquor, brewed especially for this feast, as different from the ordinary <i>saké</i> as sweet cider is from the hard cider upon which a man may drink himself into a state of intoxication.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000714\\\">[*]</$link> Besides the table service, everything that an imperial doll can be expected to need or desire is placed upon the shelves. Lacquered <i>norimono</i>, or palanquins; lacquered bullock carts, drawn by bow-legged black bulls,—these were the conveyances of the great in Old Japan, and these, in minute reproductions, are placed upon the red-covered shelves. Tiny silver and brass <i>hibachi</i>, or fire boxes, are there, with their accompanying tongs and charcoal baskets,—whole kitchens, with everything required for cooking the finest of Japanese feasts, as finely made as if for actual use; all the necessary toilet apparatus,—combs, mirrors, utensils for blackening the teeth, for shaving the eyebrows, for reddening the lips and whitening the face,—all these things are there to delight the souls of all the little girls who may have the opportunity to behold them. For three days the imperial effigies are served sumptuously at each meal, and the little girls of<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> the family take pleasure in serving their imperial majesties; but when the feast ends, the dolls and their belongings are packed away in their boxes, and lodged in the fire-proof warehouse for another year.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000089\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000089\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The Tokugawa collection, of which I have spoken, is remarkably full and costly, for it has been making for hundreds of years in one of the younger branches of a family which for two and a half centuries was possessed of almost imperial power, and lived in more than imperial luxury; but there are few households so poor that they do not from year to year accumulate a little store of toys wherewith to celebrate the feast, and, whether the toys are many or few, the feast is the event of the year in the lives of the little girls of Japan.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000716\\\">[*]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000090\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000090\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Beside the regular feasts at stated seasons, our little girl has a great variety of toys and games, some belonging to particular seasons, some played at any time during the year.

There are dolls, too, that are not relegated to the storehouse when the Feast of Dolls is ended, but who are the joy and comfort of their little mothers during the whole year; and at every <i>kwan-ko-ba</i>, or bazaar, an endless variety of games, puzzles, pictures to be cut out and glued together, and amusements of all kinds, may be purchased at extremely low rates. There is no dearth of games for our little girl, and many pleasant hours are spent in the household sitting room with games, or conundrums, or stories, or the simple girlish chatter that elicits constant laughter from sheer youthful merriment.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000091\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000091\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>As for fairy tales, so dear to the hearts of children in every country, the Japanese child has her full share.

The father's name, slightly modified, is frequently given to a son, and those of ancestors long ago dead are sometimes used. One reason for this is probably the inconvenience of similar names in the same family, and middle names, as a way of avoiding this difficulty, are unknown. The father usually names the child, but some friend or patron of the family may be asked to do it. Names of beautiful objects in nature, such as Plum, Snow, Sunshine, Lotos, Gold, are commonly used for girls, while boys of the lower classes often rejoice in such appellations as Stone, Bear, Tiger, etc. To call a child after a person would not be considered any especial compliment.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000696\\\">[*]</$link></p></div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000105\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000105\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000106\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000106\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000107\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000107\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000108\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000108\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\"><p><a></a><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000075\\\"><span class=\\\"label\\\">[3]</span></$link> That the position of the Japanese in sitting is really unnatural and unhygienic, is shown by recent measurements taken by the surgeons of the Japanese army. These measurements prove that the small stature of the Japanese is due largely to the shortness of the lower limbs, which are out of proportion to the rest of the body. The sitting from early childhood upon the legs bent at the knee, arrests the development of that part of the body, and produces an actual deformity in the whole nation. This deformity is less noticeable among the peasants, who stand and walk so much as to secure proper development of the legs; but among merchants, literary men, and others of sedentary habits, it is most plainly to be seen. The introduction of chairs and tables, as a necessary adjunct of Japanese home life, would doubtless in time alter the physique of the Japanese as a people.</p></div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000109\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000109\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000110\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000110\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000111\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000111\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000112\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000112\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\"><p><a></a><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000077\\\"><span class=\\\"label\\\">[4]</span></$link> Sometimes, in the old days, rice water was given to babies instead of milk, but it was nearly impossible to bring up a baby on this alone.

That part of her education that she gains through teachers and schools must be the subject of a separate chapter. Japan differs from most Oriental countries in the fact that her women are considered worthy of a certain amount of the culture that comes from the study of books; and although, until recently, schools for girls were unknown in the empire, nevertheless every woman, except those of the lower classes, received instruction in the ordinary written language, while some were well versed in the Chinese classics and the poetic art. These, with some musical accomplishment, an acquaintance with etiquette and the arts of arranging flowers, of making the ceremonial tea, and in many cases not only of writing a beautiful hand, but of flower-painting as well, in the old days made up the whole of<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> an ordinary woman's education. Among the lower classes, especially the merchant class, instruction was sometimes given in the various pantomimic dances which one sees most frequently presented by professional dancing girls. The art of dancing is not usually practiced by women of the higher classes, but among the daughters of the merchants special dances were learned for exhibition at home, or even at the <i>matsuri</i> or religious festival, and their performance was for the amusement of spectators, and not especially for the pleasure of the dancers themselves. These dances are modest and graceful, but from the fact that they are always learned for entertaining an audience, however small and select, and are most frequently performed by professional dancers of questionable character, the more refined and higher class Japanese do not care especially to have their daughters learn them.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000130\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000130\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the old days, little girls were not sent to school, but, going to the house of a private teacher, received the necessary instruction in reading, and writing.

To write, with a brush dipped in India ink, upon soft paper, the hand entirely without support, is an art that seldom can be acquired by a grown person, but when learned in childhood it gives great deftness in whatever other art may be subsequently studied. This is perhaps the reason why the Japanese value a good handwriting more highly than any other accomplishment, for it denotes a manual dexterity that is the secret of success in all the arts, and one who writes the Chinese characters well and rapidly can quickly learn to do anything else with the fingers.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000131\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000131\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The fault that one finds with the Japanese system—a fault that lies deeper than the mere methods of teaching, and has its root in the ideographic character of the written language—is that, while it cultivates the memory and powers of observation to a remarkable extent, and while it gives great skill in the use of the fingers,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> it affords little opportunity for the development of the reasoning powers.<a></a><$link class=\\\"fnanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000152\\\">[8]</$link> The<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> years of study that are required for mastering the written language, so as to be able to grasp the thoughts already given to the world, leave comparatively little time for the conducting of any continuous thought on one's own account, and so we find in Japanese scholars—whether boys or girls—quickness of apprehension, retentive memories, industry and method in their study of their lessons, but not much originality of thought.

As these two things, the vase of flowers and the hanging scroll, are the only adornments, it is more necessary that the flowers should be carefully arranged, than in our crowded rooms, where a vase of flowers may easily escape the eye, perplexed by the multitude of objects which surround it.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000135\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000135\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The ceremonial tea must not be confounded with the ordinary serving of tea for refreshment. The proper making, and serving, and drinking of the ceremonial tea is the most formal of social observances, each step in which is prescribed by a rigid code of etiquette. The tea, instead of being the whole leaf, such as is used for ordinary occasions, is a fine, green powder. The infusion is made, not in a small pot, from which it is poured out into cups, but in a bowl, into which the hot water is poured from a dipper on to the powdered tea. The mixture is stirred with a bamboo whisk until it foams, then handed with<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> much ceremony to the guest, who takes it with equal ceremony and drinks it from the bowl, emptying the receptacle at three gulps. Should there be a number of guests, tea is made for each in turn, in the order of their rank, in the same bowl. For this ceremonial tea, a special set of utensils is used, all of antique and severely simple style. The charcoal used for heating the water is of a peculiar variety; and the room in which the tea is made and served is built for that special purpose, and kept sacred for that use. This art, which is often part of the education of women of the higher classes, is taught by regular teachers, often by gentlewomen who have fallen into distressed circumstances.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000725\\\">[*]</$link> I remember with great vividness a visit paid to an old lady living near a provincial city of Japan, who had for years supported herself by giving lessons in this politest of arts. Her little house, of the daintiest and neatest type, seemed filled to overflowing by three foreigners, whom she received with the courtliest of welcomes. At the request of my friend, an American lady engaged in missionary work in that part of the country, she gave us a lesson in the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> etiquette of the tea ceremony. Every motion, from the bringing in and arranging of the utensils to the final rinsing and wiping of the tea bowl, was according to rules strictly laid down, and the whole ceremony had more the solemnity of a religious ritual than the lightness and gayety of a social occasion.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000136\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000136\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Etiquette of all kinds is not left in Japan to chance, to be learned by observation and imitation of any model that may present itself, but is taught regularly by teachers who make a specialty of it. Everything in the daily life has its rules, and the etiquette teacher has them all at her fingers' ends. There have been several famous teachers of etiquette, and they have formed systems which differ in minor points, while agreeing in the principal rules. The etiquette of bowing, the position of the body, the arms, and the head while saluting, the methods of shutting and opening the door, rising and sitting down on the floor, the manner of serving a meal, or tea, are all, with the minutest details, taught to the young girls, who, I imagine, find it rather irksome. I know two young girls of new Japan who find nothing so wearisome as<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> their etiquette lesson, and would gladly be excused from it. I have heard them, after their teacher had left, slyly make fun of her stiff and formal manners. Such people as she will, I fear, soon belong only to the past, though it still remains to be seen how much of European manners will be engrafted on the old formalities of Japanese life. It is, perhaps, because of this regular teaching in the ways of polite society, that the Japanese girl seems never at a loss, even under unusual circumstances, but bears herself with self-possession in places where young girls in America would be embarrassed and awkward.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000137\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000137\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>But the Japanese are rapidly finding out that this busy nineteenth century gives little time for learning how to shut and open doors in the politest manner, and indeed such things under the newly established school system are now relegated entirely to the girls' schools, the boys having no lessons in etiquette.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000138\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000138\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The method of teaching flower-painting is so interesting that I must speak of it before I leave the subject of accomplishments. I have said that the acquisition of skill in writing the Chinese characters was<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> the best possible preparation for skill in all other arts. This is especially true of the art of painting, which is simply the next step, after writing has been learned. The painting master, when he comes to the house, brings no design as a model, but sits down on the floor before the little desk, and on a sheet of paper paints with great rapidity the design that he wishes the pupil to copy. It may be simply two or three blades of grass upon which the pupil makes a beginning, but she is expected to make her picture with exactly the same number of bold strokes that the master puts into his. Again and again she blunders her strokes on to a sheet of paper, until at last, when sheet after sheet has been spoiled, she begins to see some semblance of the master's copy in her own daub. She perseveres, making copy after copy, until she is able from memory to put upon the paper at a moment's notice the three blades of grass to her master's satisfaction. Only then can she go on to a new copy, and only after many such designs have been committed to memory, and the free, dashing stroke necessary for Japanese painting has been acquired, is<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> she allowed to undertake any copying from nature, or original designing.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000727\\\">[*]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000139\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000139\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>I have dwelt thus far only upon the entirely Japanese education that was permitted to women under the old régime. That it was an effective and refining system, all can testify who have made the acquaintance of any of the charming Japanese ladies whose schooling was finished before Commodore Perry disturbed the repose of old Japan. As I write, the image comes before me of a sweet-faced, bright-eyed little gentlewoman with whom it was my good fortune to become intimately acquainted during my stay in Tōkyō. A widow, left penniless, with one child to support, she earned the merest pittance by teaching sewing at one of the government schools in Tōkyō; but in all the circumstances of her life, narrow and busy as it needs must be, she proved herself a lady through and through. Polite, cheerful, an intelligent and cultivated reader, a thrifty housekeeper, a loving and careful mother, a true and helpful friend, her memory is associated with many of my pleasantest hours in Japan, and she is but one of the many who bear witness to the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> culture that might be acquired by women in the old days.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000140\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000140\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>But the Japan of old is not the Japan of to-day, and in the school system now prevalent throughout the empire girls and boys are equally provided for. First the schools established by the various missionary societies, and then the government schools, offered to girls a broader education than the old instruction in Chinese, in etiquette, and in accomplishments. Now, every morning, the streets of the cities and villages are alive with boys and girls clattering along, with their books and lunch boxes in their hands, to the kindergarten, primary, grammar, high, or normal school.

The work required would be a burden to the quickest mind. The whole of the old education in Japanese and Chinese literature and composition—an <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>education requiring the best years of a boy's life—is given, and grafted upon this, our common-school and high-school studies of mathematics, geography, history, and natural science. In addition to these, at all higher schools, one foreign language is required, and often two, English ranking first in the popular estimation. Many a headache do the poor, hard-working students have over the puzzling English language, in which they have to begin at the wrong end of the book and read across the page from left to right, instead of from top to bottom, and from right to left, as is natural to them. But in spite of its hard work, the new school life is cheerful and healthful, and the children enjoy it. It helps them to be really children, and, while they are young, to be merry and playful, not dignified and formal little ladies at all times. Upon the young girls, the influence of the schools is to make them more independent, self-reliant, and stronger women. In the houses of the higher classes, even now, much of the old-time system of repression is still in force. Children are indeed &quot;seen but not heard,&quot; and from the time when they<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> learn to walk they must learn to be polite and dignified. At school, the more progressive feeling of the times predominates among the authorities, and the children are encouraged to unbend and enjoy themselves in games and frolics, as true children should do. Much is done for the pleasure of the little ones, who often enjoy school better than home, and declare that they do not like holidays.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000730\\\">[*]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000142\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000142\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>But the young girl, who has finished this pleasant school life, with all its advantages, is not as well fitted as under the old system for the duties and trials of married life, unless under exceptional circumstances, where the husband chosen has advanced ideas.

One of them is the one already referred to, the problem of how best to combine the new and the old in the school curriculum. That the old learning and literature, the old politeness and sweetness of manner, must not be given up or made little of, is evident to every right-minded student of the matter. That the newer and broader culture, with its higher morality, its greater development of the best powers of the mind, must play a large part in the Japan of the future, there is not a shadow of doubt, and the women must not be left behind in the onward movement of the nation. But how to give to the young minds the best products of the thought of two such distinct civilizations is a question that is as yet unanswered, and cannot be satisfactorily settled until the effect of the new education has begun to show itself in a generation or so of graduates from the new schools. Another difficulty is in the matter of health. Most of the new school-houses are fitted with seats and desks, such as are found in American schools. Many of them are<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> heated by stoves or furnaces. The scholars in most cases wear the Japanese dress, which in winter is made warm enough to be worn in rooms having no artificial heat. Put this warm costume into an artificially heated room and the result is an over-heating of the body, and a subsequent chill when the pupil goes, with no extra covering, into the keen out-of-door air. From this cause alone, arise many colds and lung troubles, which can be prevented when more experience has shown how the costumes of the East and West can be combined to suit the new conditions. Another part of the health problem lies in the fact that in many cases the parents do not understand the proper care of a growing girl, ambitious to excel in her studies. Instead of the regular hours, healthful food, and gentle restraint that a girl needs under those circumstances, our little Japanese maiden is allowed to sit up to any hour of the night, or arise at any hour in the morning, to prepare her lessons, is given food of most indigestible quality at all hours of the day between her regular meals, and is frequently urged to greater mental exertion than her delicate body can endure.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000145\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000145\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000146\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000146\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Another difficulty, in fitting the new school system into the customs of the people, lies in the early age at which marriages are contracted. Before the girl has finished her school course, her parents begin to wonder whether there is not danger of her being left on their hands altogether, if they do not hand her over to the first eligible young man who presents himself. Sometimes the girl makes a brave fight, and remains in school until her course is finished; more often she succumbs and is married off, bids a weeping farewell to her teachers and schoolmates, and leaves the school, to become a wife at sixteen, a mother at eighteen, and an old woman at thirty. In some cases, the breaking down of a girl's health may be traced to threats on the part of her parents that, if she does not take a certain rank in her studies, she will be taken from school and married off.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000732\\\">[*]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000147\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000147\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>These are difficulties that may be overcome when a generation has been educated who can, as parents, avoid the mistakes that now endanger the health of a Japanese school-girl. In the mean time, boarding schools, that can attend to matters of health and hygiene among the girls, would,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> if they could be conducted with the proper admixture of Eastern and Western learning and manners, do a great deal toward educating that generation. The missionary schools do much in this direction, but the criticism of the Japanese upon the manners of the girls educated in missionary schools is universally severe. To a foreigner who has lived almost entirely among Japanese ladies of pure Japanese education, the manners of the girls in these schools seem brusque and awkward; and though they are many of them noble women and doing noble work, there is room for hope that in the future of Japan the charm of manner which is the distinguishing feature of the Japanese woman will not be lost by contact with our Western shortness and roughness. A happy mean undoubtedly can be reached; and when it is, the women of new Japan will be able to bear a not unfavorable comparison with the women of the old régime.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000148\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000148\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000149\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000149\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><h3><span class=\\\"smcap\\\">Footnotes:</span></h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000150\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000150\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000151\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000151\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000152\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000152\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\"><p><a></a><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000131\\\"><span class=\\\"label\\\">[8]</span></$link> The Japanese written language is a strange combination of Chinese and Japanese, to read which a knowledge of the Chinese characters is necessary. Chinese literature written in the Chinese ideographs, which of course give no clue to the sound, are read by Japanese with the Japanese rendering of the words, and the Japanese order of words in the sentence. When there have not been exact equivalent Japanese words, a Chinese term has come into use, so that much corrupt Chinese is now well engrafted into the Japanese language, both written and spoken. In the forming of new words and technical terms Chinese words are used, as the Greek and Latin are here. There is probably no similarity in the origin of the two languages, but the Japanese borrowed from the Chinese about the sixth century <span class=\\\"ucsmcap\\\">A.

The introduction of the Chinese literature has done much for Japan, and to master this language is one of the essentials in the education of every boy.

This letter did its work, for on the next lucky day, about ten days later, the bride appeared, and Yasaku was given two days of holiday on the agreement that he should not be married again while he remained in my service. On the evening of the second day, the bride came in to pay me her respects, and, crouching on her hands and knees before me, literally trembled under the excitement of her first introduction to a foreigner.

Upon one occasion, when I was visiting a Japanese lady of high rank who kept a retinue of servants, the woman who came in with the tea bowed and smiled upon me as if greeting me after a long absence. As I was in and out of the house nearly every day, I was a little surprised at this demonstration, which was quite different from the formal bow that is given by the servant to her mistress's guest upon ordinary occasions. When she went out my friend said, &quot;You see O Kiku has come back.&quot; As I did not know that the woman had been away, the news of her return did not affect me greatly until I learned the history of her departure. It seemed that about a month before, she had left her mistress's house to be married; and the day before my visit she had quietly presented herself, and announced that she had come back, if they would take her in. My friend had asked her what had happened,—whether she had found her husband <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>unkind. No, her husband was very nice, very kind and good, but his mother was simply unbearable; she made her work so hard that she actually had no time to rest at all. She had known before her marriage that her proposed mother-in-law was a hard task-mistress, but her husband had promised that his mother should live with his older brother, and they should have their housekeeping quite independent and separate. As the mother was then living with her older son, it seemed unlikely that she would care to move, and O Kiku San had married on that supposition. But it seemed that the wife of the older brother was both lazy and bad-tempered, and the new wife of the younger brother soon proved herself industrious and good-natured. As the mother's main thought was to go where she would get the most comfort and waiting upon, she moved from the elder son's house to that of her younger son, and began leading her new daughter-in-law such a life that she soon gave up the effort to live with her husband, sued for a divorce, obtained it, and was back in her old place, all in a month's time from the date of her marriage.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000192\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000192\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000193\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000193\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>But our readers must not suppose, from the various incidents given, that few happy marriages take place in Japan, or that, in every rank of life, divorce is of every-day occurrence. On the contrary, there seems cause for wonder, not that there are so many divorces, but that there are so many happy marriages, with wives and husbands devoted and faithful. For a nobleman in the olden times to divorce his wife would have caused such a scandal and talk that it rarely occurred. If the wife were disliked, he need have little or nothing to do with her, their rooms, their meals, and their attendance being entirely separate, but he rarely took away from her the name of wife, empty as it might be. She usually would be from some other noble house, and great trouble would arise between the families if he attempted to divorce her. The <i>samurai</i> also, with the same loyalty which they displayed for their lords, were loyal to their wives, and many a novel has been written, or play acted, showing the devotion of husband and wife. The quiet, undemonstrative love, though very different from the ravings of a lover in the nineteenth century novel, is perhaps truer to life.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000194\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000194\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000195\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000195\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Among the merchants and lower classes there has been, and is, a much lower standard of morality, but the few years which have passed since the Revolution of 1868 are not a fair sample of what Japan has been.

That these evils will be remedied in time, there seems little reason to doubt, but just now the various cooks who are engaged in brewing the broth of the new civilization are disagreed in regard to the condiments required for its proper flavoring. The conservatives wish to flavor strongly with the subjection and dependence of women, believing that only by that means can feminine virtue be preserved. The younger men, of foreign education, would drop into the boiling pot the flavor of culture and broader outlook; for by this means they hope to secure happier homes for all, and better mothers for their children. The missionaries and native Christians believe that, when the whole mixture is well impregnated with practical Christianity, the desired result will be achieved. All are agreed on this point, that a strong public opinion is necessary before improved legislation can produce much effect; and so, for the present, legislation remains in the background, until the time shall come when it can be used in the right way.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000197\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000197\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000198\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000198\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Let us examine the two remedies suggested by the reformers, and see what effect has been produced by each so far, and what may be expected of them in the future. Taking education first, what are the effects produced so far by educating women to a point above the old Japanese standard? In many happy homes to-day, we find husbands educated abroad, and knowing something of the home life of foreign lands, who have sought out wives of broad intellectual culture, and who make them friends and confidants, not simply housekeepers and head-servants. In such homes the wife has freedom, not such as is enjoyed by American women, perhaps, but equal to that of most European women. In such homes love and equality rule, and the power of the mother-in-law grows weak. To her is paid due respect, but she seldom has the despotic control which often makes the beginning of married life hard to the Japanese wife. These homes are sending out healthy influences that are daily having their effect, and raising the position of women in Japan.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000199\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000199\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>But for the young girl whose mind has been broadened by the new education, and<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> who marries, as the majority of Japanese girls must, not in accordance with her own wishes, but in obedience to the will of her parents, a hard life is in store. A woman's education, under the old régime, was one that fitted her well for the position that she was to occupy. The higher courses of study only serve to make her kick against the pricks, and render herself miserable where she might before have been happy. With mind and character developed by education, she may be obliged to enter the home of her husband's family, to be perhaps one among many members under the same roof. In the training of her own children, in the care of her own health and theirs, her wishes and judgment must often yield to the prejudices of those above her, under whose authority she is, and it may not be until many years have passed that she will be in a position to influence in any measure the lives of those nearest and dearest to her. Then, too, her life must be passed entirely within the home, with no opportunities to meet or to mingle with the great world of which she has read and studied. Surely her lot is harder than that of the woman of the olden time, whose<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> plain duty always lay in the path of implicit obedience to her superiors, and who never for one moment considered obedience to the dictates of her own reason and conscience as an obligation higher than deference to the wishes of husband and parents. Education, without further amelioration of their lot as wives and mothers, can but result in making the women discontented and unhappy,—in many cases injuring their health by worry over the constant petty disappointments and baffled desires of their lives.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000200\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000200\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>This to superficial observers would seem a step backward rather than forward, and it is to this cause that the present reaction against female education may be traced.

Wherever one finds in Japan a Christian home, there one finds the wife and mother occupying the position that she occupies all over Christendom. The Christian man, in choosing his wife, feels that it is not an ordinary contract, which may be dissolved at any time at the will of the contracting parties, but that it is a union for life. Consequently, in making his choice he is more careful, takes more time, and thinks more of the personal qualities of the woman he is about to marry. Thus the chances are better at the beginning for the establishment of a happy home, and such homes form centres of influence throughout the length and breadth of the land to-day. Christianity in the future will do much to mould public sentiment in the right way, and can be trusted as a force that is sure to grow in time to be a mighty power in the councils of the nation.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000203\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000203\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>One more remedy might be suggested, as a preliminary to proper legislation, or a necessary accompaniment of it, and that is, the opening of new avenues of employment <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>for women, and especially for women of the cultivated classes. To-day marriage, no matter how distasteful, is the only opening for a woman; for she can do nothing for her own support, and cannot require her father to support her after she has reached a marriageable age. As new ways of self-support present themselves, and a woman may look forward to making a single life tolerable by her own labor, the intelligent girls of the middle class will no longer accept marriage as inevitable, but will only marry when the suitor can offer a good home, kindness, affection, and security in the tenure of these blessings. So far, there is little employment for women, except as teachers; but even this change in the condition of things is forming a class, as yet small, but increasing yearly, of women who enjoy a life of independence, though accompanied by much hard work, more than the present life of a Japanese married woman. In this class we find some of the most intelligent and respected of the women of new Japan; and the growth of this class is one of the surest signs that the present state of the laws and customs concerning marriage and<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> divorce is so unsatisfactory to the women that it must eventually be remedied, if the educated and intelligent of the men care to take for their wives, and for the mothers of their children, any but the less educated and less intelligent of the women of their own nation.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000204\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000204\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000205\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000205\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><h3><span class=\\\"smcap\\\">Footnotes:</span></h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000206\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000206\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000207\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000207\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000208\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000208\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\"><p><a></a><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000171\\\"><span class=\\\"label\\\">[11]</span></$link> The Japanese standard of female beauty differs in many respects from our own, so that it is almost impossible for a foreigner visiting Japan to comprehend the judgments of the Japanese in regard to the beauty of their own women, and even more impossible for the untraveled Japanese to discover the reasons for a foreigner's judgments upon either Japanese or foreign beauties. To the Japanese, the ideal female face must be long and narrow; the forehead high and narrow in the middle, but widening and lowering at the sides, conforming to the outline of the beloved Fuji, the mountain that Japanese art loves to picture. The hair should be straight and glossy black, and absolutely smooth. Japanese ladies who have the misfortune to have any wave or ripple in their hair, as many of them do, are at as much pains to straighten it in the dressing as American ladies are to simulate a natural curl, when Nature has denied them that charm. The eyes should be long and narrow, slanting upward at the outer corners; and the eyebrows should be delicate lines, high above the eye itself. The distinctly aquiline nose should be low at the bridge, the curve outward beginning much lower down than upon the Caucasian face; and the eye-socket should not be outlined at all, either by the brow, the cheek, or by the nose. It is this flatness of the face about the eyes that gives the mildness of expression to all young people of Mongolian type that is so noticeable a trait always in their physiognomy. The mouth of an aristocratic Japanese lady must be small, and the lips full and red; the neck, a conspicuous feature always when the Japanese dress is worn, should be long and slender, and gracefully curved. The complexion should be light,—a clear ivory-white, with little color in the cheeks. The blooming country girl style of beauty is not admired, and everything, even to color in the cheeks, must be sacrificed to gain the delicacy that is the <i>sine qua non</i> of the Japanese beauty. The figure should be slender, the waist long, but not especially small, and the hips narrow, to secure the best effect with the Japanese dress. The head and shoulders should be carried slightly forward, and the body should also be bent forward slightly at the waist, to secure the most womanly and aristocratic carriage. In walking, the step should be short and quick, with the toes turned in, and the foot lifted so slightly that either clog or sandal will scuff with every step. This is necessary for modesty, with the narrow skirt of the Japanese dress.</p></div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000209\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000209\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000210\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000210\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\"><p>Contrast with this type the fair, curling hair, the round blue eyes, the rosy cheeks, the erect, slim-waisted, large-hipped figures of many foreign beauties,—the rapid, long, clean-stepping walk, and the air of almost masculine strength and independence, which belongs especially to English and American women,—and one can see how the Japanese find little that they recognize as beauty among them. Blue eyes, set into deep sockets, and with the bridge of the nose rising as a barrier between them, impart a fierce grotesqueness to the face, that the untraveled Japanese seldom admire. The very babies will scream with horror at first sight of a blue-eyed, light-haired foreigner, and it is only after considerable familiarity with such persons that they can be induced to show anything but the wildest fright in their presence. Foreigners who have lived a great deal among the Japanese find their standards unconsciously changing, and see, to their own surprise, that their countrywomen look ungainly, fierce, aggressive, and awkward among the small, mild, shrinking, and graceful Japanese ladies.</p></div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000211\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000211\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000212\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000212\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000213\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000213\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000214\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000214\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\"><p><a></a><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000171\\\"><span class=\\\"label\\\">[12]</span></$link> The present from the groom is usually a piece of handsome silk, used for the <i>obi</i> or girdle.

She governs and directs the household, if it be a large one, and her position is one of much care and responsibility; but she is not the intimate friend of her husband, is in no sense his confidante or adviser, except in trivial affairs of the household. She appears rarely with him in public, is expected always to wait upon him and save him steps, and must bear all things from him with smiling face and agreeable manners, even to the receiving with open arms into the household some other woman, whom she knows to bear the relation of concubine to her own husband.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000229\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000229\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In return for this, she has, if she be of the higher classes, much respect and honor from those beneath her.

It lies with her alone to make the home a pleasant one, or to make it unpleasant. Nothing is expected of the husband in this direction; he may do as he likes with his own, and no one will blame him; but if his home is not happy, even through his own folly or bad temper, the blame will fall upon his wife, who should by management do whatever is necessary to supply the deficiencies caused by her husband's shortcomings. In all things the husband goes first, the wife second. If the husband drops his fan or his handkerchief the wife picks it up. The husband is served first, the wife afterwards, and so on through the countless minutiæ of daily life.

If the maiden's lot is to be the first daughter-in-law in a large family, she becomes simply the one of the family from whom the most drudgery is expected, who obtains the fewest favors, and who is expected to have always the pleasantest of tempers under circumstances not altogether conducive to repose of spirit.

Her sphere is within her home, and though, unlike other Asiatic women, she goes without restraint alone through the streets, she does not concern herself with the great world, nor is she occupied with such a round of social duties as fill the lives of society women in this country. Yet she is not barred out from all intercourse with the outer world, for there are sometimes great dinner parties, given perhaps at home, when she must appear as hostess, side by side with her husband, and share with him the duty of entertaining the guests. There are, besides, smaller gatherings of friends of her husband, when she must see that the proper refreshments are served, if they be only the omnipresent tea and cake. She may, perhaps, join in the number and listen to the conversation; but if there are no ladies, she will probably not appear, except to attend to the wants of her guests. There are also lady visitors—friends and relatives—who come to make calls, oftentimes from a<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> distance, and nearly always unexpectedly, whose entertainment devolves on the wife. Owing to the great distances in many of the cities, and the difficulties that used to attend going from place to place, it has become a custom not to make frequent visits, but long ones at long intervals. A guest often stays several hours, remaining to lunch or dinner, as the case may be, and, should the distance be great, may spend the night. So rigid are the requirements of Japanese hospitality that no guest is ever allowed to leave a house without having been pressed to partake of food, if it be only tea and cake. Even tradesmen or messengers who come to the house must be offered tea, and if carpenters, gardeners, or workmen of any kind are employed about the house, tea must be served in the middle of the afternoon with a light lunch, and tea sent out to them often during their day's work. If a guest arrives in <i>jinrikisha</i>, not only the guest, but the <i>jinrikisha</i> men must be supplied with refreshments.

To the uninitiated foreigner, the general effect of the loosely worn <i>kimono</i> is the same, whether the garment be well or ill made; but the skillful seamstress can easily discover that this seam is not turned just as it should be, or that those stitches are too long or too short, or carelessly or unevenly set.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000238\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000238\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000239\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000239\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Fancy work<a></a><$link class=\\\"fnanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000272\\\">[17]</$link> or embroidery is not done in the house, the gorgeous embroidered Japanese robes being the product of professional workmen.

No thick walls and long passageways separate the nursery from the grown people's apartments, but the thin paper partitions make it possible for the mother to know always what her children are doing, and whether they are good and gentle with their nurses, or irritable and passionate. The children never leave the house, nor return to it, without going to their mother's room, and there making the little bows and repeating the customary phrases used upon such occasions. In the same way, when the mother goes out, all the servants and the children escort her to the door; and when her attendant shouts &quot;<i>O kaeri</i>,&quot; which is the signal of her return, children and servants hasten to the gate to greet her, and do what they can to help her from her conveyance and make her home-coming pleasant and restful.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000245\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000245\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The father has little to do with the training of his children, which is left almost entirely to the mother, and, except for the interference of the mother-in-law, she has her own way in their training, until they are long past childhood.

The Japanese woman has so few on whom to lavish her affection, so little to live for beside her children, and no hopes in the future except through them, that it is no wonder that<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> she devotes her life to their care and service, deeming the drudgery that custom requires of her for them the easiest of all her duties. Even with plenty of servants, the mother performs for her children nearly all the duties often delegated to nurses in this country. Mother and babe are rarely separated, night or day, during the first few years of the baby's life, and the mother denies herself any entertainment or journey from home when the baby cannot accompany her. To give the husband any share in the baby-work would be an unheard-of thing, and a disgrace to the wife; for in public and in private the baby is the mother's sole charge, and the husband is never asked to sit up all night with a sick baby, or to mind it in any way at all. Nothing in all one's study of Japanese life seems more beautiful and admirable than the influence of the mother over her children,—an influence that is gentle and all-pervading, bringing out all that is sweetest and noblest in the feminine character, and affording the one almost unlimited opportunity of a Japanese woman's life. The lot of a childless wife in Japan is a sad<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> one. Not only is she denied the hopes and the pleasures of a mother in her children, but she is an object of pity to her friends, and well does she know that Confucius has laid down the law that a man is justified in divorcing a childless wife. All feel that through her, innocent though she is, the line has ceased; that her duty is unfulfilled; and that, though the name be given to adopted sons, there is no heir of the blood. A man rarely sends away his wife solely with this excuse, but children are the strongest of the ties which bind together husband and wife, and the childless wife is far less sure of pleasing her husband. In many cases she tries to make good her deficiencies by her care of adopted children; in them she often finds the love which fills the void in her heart and home, and she receives from them in after-life the respect and care which is the crown of old age.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000247\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000247\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>We have hitherto spoken of married life when the wife is received into her husband's home. Another interesting side of Japanese marriage is when a man enters the wife's family, taking her name and becoming entirely one of her family, as<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> usually the wife becomes of the husband's. When there are daughters but no sons in a family to inherit the name, one of three things may happen: a son may be adopted early in life and grow up as heir; or he may be adopted with the idea of marrying one of the daughters; or, again, no one may have been formally adopted, but on the eldest daughter's coming to a marriageable age, her family and friends seek for her a <i>yōshi</i>, that is to say, some man (usually a younger son) who is willing and able to give up his family name, and, by marrying the daughter, become a member of her family and heir to the name. He cuts off all ties from his own family, and becomes a member of hers, and the young couple are expected to live with her parents. In this case the tables are turned, and it is he who has to dread the mother-in-law; it is his turn to have to please his new relatives and to do all he can to be agreeable. He, too, may be sent away and divorced by the all-powerful parents, if he does not please; and such divorces are not uncommon. Of course, in such marriages, the woman has the greater power, and the man has to remember what he owes her;<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> and though the woman yields to him obediently in all respects, it is an obedience not demanded by the husband, as under other circumstances. In such marriages the children belong to the family whose name they bear, so that in case of divorce they remain in the wife's family, unless some special arrangement is made about them.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000248\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000248\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>It may be wondered why young men ever care to enter a family as <i>yōshi</i>. There is only one answer,—it is the attraction of wealth and rank, very rarely that of the daughter herself. In the houses of rich <i>daimiōs</i> without sons, <i>yōshi</i> are very common, and there are many younger sons of the nobility, themselves of high birth, but without prospects, who are glad enough to become great lords. In feudal times, the number of <i>samurai</i> families was limited. Several sons of one family could not establish different <i>samurai</i> families, but all but the eldest son, if they formed separate houses, must enroll themselves among the ranks of the common people. Hence the younger sons were often adopted into other <i>samurai</i> families as <i>yōshi</i>, where it was desired to secure a succession to a name that must otherwise die out. Since the Restoration, <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>and the breaking down of the old class distinctions, young men care more for independence than for their rank as <i>samurai</i>; and it is now quite difficult to find <i>yōshi</i> to enter <i>samurai</i> families, unless it be because of the attractiveness and beauty of the young lady herself. Many a young girl who could easily make a good marriage with some suitable husband, could she enter his family, is now obliged to take some inferior man as <i>yōshi</i>, because few men in these days are willing to change their names, give up their independence, and take upon themselves the support of aged parents-in-law; for this also is expected of the <i>yōshi</i>, unless the family that he enters is a wealthy one.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000249\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000249\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>From this custom of <i>yōshi</i>, and its effect upon the wife's position, we see that, in certain cases, Japanese women are treated as equal with men. It is not because of their sex that they are looked down upon and held in subjection, but it is because of their almost universal dependence of position. The men have the right of inheritance, the education, habits of self-reliance, and are the bread-winners. Wherever the tables are turned, and the men are dependents <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>of the women, and even where the women are independent of the men,—there we find the relations of men to women vastly changed. The women of Japan must know how to do some definite work in the world beyond the work of the home, so that their position will not be one of entire dependence upon father, husband, or son. If fathers divided their estates between sons and daughters alike, and women were given, before the law, right to hold property in their own names, much would be accomplished towards securing them in their positions as wives and mothers; and divorce, the great evil of Japanese home life to-day, would become simply a last resort to preserve the purity of the home, as it is in most civilized countries now.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000250\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000250\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The difference between the women of the lower and those of the higher classes, in the matter of equality with their husbands, is quite noticeable.

The peasant and his wife work side by side in the field, put their shoulders to the same wheel, eat together in the same room, at the same time, and whichever of them happens to be the stronger in character governs the house, without regard to sex. There is no great gulf fixed between them, and there is frequently a consideration for the wife shown by husbands of the lower class, that is not unlike what we see in our own country. I remember the case of a <i>jinrikisha</i> man employed by a friend of mine in Tōkyō, who was much laughed at by his friends because he actually used to spend some of his leisure moments in drawing the water required for his household from a well some distance away, and carrying the heavy buckets to the house, in order to save the strength of his little, delicate wife. That cases of such devotion are rare is no doubt true, but that they occur shows that there is here and there a recognition of the claims that feminine weakness has upon masculine strength.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000251\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000251\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>A frequent sight in the morning, in Tōkyō, is a cart heavily laden with wood, charcoal, or some other country produce,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> creaking slowly along the streets, propelled by a farmer and his family.

But when evening comes, and the load of produce has been disposed of, the woman and baby are seen seated upon the cart, while the two men pull it back to their home in some neighboring village.

It must be said, however, to the credit of many husbands, that in spite of this privilege, which custom allows, there are many men of the old school who are faithful to one wife, and never introduce this discordant element into the household. Even should he keep <i>mékaké</i>, it is often unknown to the wife, and she is placed in a separate establishment of her own. And in spite of the code of morals requiring submission in any case on the part of the woman, there are many wives of the <i>samurai</i> and lower classes who have enough spirit and wit to prevent their husbands<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> from ever introducing a rival under the same roof.

She submits unquestioningly to the custom requiring that the wife treat these women with all civility. Their children she may even have to adopt as her own. The lot of the <i>mékaké</i> herself is rendered the less endurable, from the American point of view, by the fact that, should the father of her child decide to make it his heir, the mother is thenceforth no more to it than any other of the servants of the household. For instance, suppose a hitherto childless noble is presented with a son by one of his concubines, and he decides by legal adoption to make that son his heir: the child at its birth, or as soon afterwards as is practicable, is taken from its mother and placed in other hands, and the mother never sees her own child until, on the thirtieth day after its birth, she goes with the other servants of the household to pay her respects to her young master. If it were not for the habit of abject obedience to parents which Japanese <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>custom has exalted into the one feminine virtue, few women could be found of respectable families who would take a position so devoid of either honor or satisfaction of any kind as that of <i>mékaké</i>. That these positions are not sought after must be said, to the honor of Japanese womanhood. A nobleman may obtain <i>samurai</i> women for his &quot;<i>O mékaké</i>&quot; (literally, honorable concubines), but they are never respected by their own class for taking such positions.

In an imperial progress made through the streets of Tōkyō, the Emperor and Empress, for the first time in the history of Japan, rode together in the imperial coach.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000750\\\">[*]</$link> Until then, the Emperor, attended by his chief gentlemen-in-waiting and his guards, had always headed the procession, while the Empress must follow at a distance with her own attendants. That this act on the part of the Emperor signifies the beginning of a new and better era for the women of Japan, we cannot but hope; for until the position of the wife and mother in Japan is improved and made secure, little permanence can be expected in the progress of the nation toward what is best and highest in the Western civilization. Better laws, broader education for the women, a change in public opinion on the subject, caused by the study, by the men educated abroad, of the homes of Europe and America,—these are the forces which alone can bring the women of Japan up to that place in the home which their intellectual and moral qualities fit them to fill. That Japan is infinitely ahead of other Oriental countries<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> in her practices in this matter is greatly to her credit; but that she is far behind the civilized nations of Europe and America, not only in practice but in theory, is a fact that is incontestable, and a fact that, unless changed, must sooner or later be a stumbling-block in the path of her progress toward the highest civilization of which she is capable.<a></a><$link class=\\\"fnanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000288\\\">[21]</$link> The European practice cannot be grafted upon the Asiatic theory, but the change in the home must be a radical one, to secure permanent good results. As long as the wife has no rights which the husband is bound to respect, no great advance<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> can be made, for human nature is too mean and selfish to give in all cases to those who are entirely unprotected by law, and entirely unable to protect themselves, those things which the moral nature declares to be their due. In the old slave times in the South, many of the negroes were better fed, better cared for, and happier than they are to-day; but they were nevertheless at the mercy of men who too often thought only of themselves, and not of the human bodies and souls over which they had unlimited power. It was a condition of things that could not be prevented by educating the masters so as to induce them to be kind to their slaves; it was a condition that was wrong in theory, and so could not be righted in practice. In the same way the position of the Japanese wife is wrong in theory, and can never be righted until legislation has given to her rights which it still denies. Education will but aggravate the trouble to a point beyond endurance. The giving to the wife power to obtain a divorce will not help much, but simply tend to weaken still further the marriage tie. Nothing can help surely and permanently but the growth of a sound<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> public opinion, in regard to the position of the wife, that will, sooner or later, have its effect upon the laws of the country. Legislation once effected, all the rest will come, and the wife, secure in her home and her children, will be at the point where her new education can be of use to her in the administration of her domestic affairs and the training of her children; and where she will finally become the friend and companion of her husband, instead of his mere waitress, seamstress, and housekeeper,—the plaything of his leisure moments, too often the victim of his caprices.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000260\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000260\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000261\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000261\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><h3><span class=\\\"smcap\\\">Footnotes:</span></h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000262\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000262\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000263\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000263\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000264\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000264\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\"><p><a></a><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000232\\\"><span class=\\\"label\\\">[15]</span></$link> The <i>andon</i> is the standing lamp, inclosed in a paper case, used as a night lamp in all Japanese houses.

Their excuse is, that such power in the hands of the husband over his wife might be abused, but that in fact it is not. Wrongs and injustice are rare, they argue, and kind treatment, affection, and even respect for the wife is the general rule; and that the keeping of the power in the hands of the husband is better than giving too much freedom to women who are without education.

Her bent form and wrinkled face are ever welcome to her children,—hers by the right of years of patient care and toil for them. They now, in their turn, enjoy giving her pleasure, and return to her all the love she has lavished upon them.

Mounted on little ladders, they pick and scrape with knives until the wall is clear and fresh, with no insidious growth to push the great uncemented stones out of their places.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000302\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000302\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In contrast with these humble but cheerful toilers may be mentioned another class of women, often met with in the great cities.

The fact that her hair is still growing to its natural length shows that she is still a wife and not a widow; her worn and patched blue cotton clothes, bleached light from much washing, show that extreme poverty is her lot in life; and as she hobbles along with the gait peculiar to those who carry a yoke, my thoughts are busy with her home, which, though poor and small, is doubtless clean and comfortable, but my eye follows her through the city's crowd, where laborer, soldier, student, and high official jostle each other by the way. Suddenly I<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> see her pause before the gateway of a temple. She sets her burden down, and there in the midst of the bustling throng, with bowed head, folded hands, and moving lips, she invokes her god, snatching this moment from her busy life to seek a blessing for herself and her dear ones. The throng moves busily on, making a little eddy around the burden she has laid down, but paying no heed to the devout little figure standing there; then in a moment the prayer is finished; she stoops, picks up her yoke, balances it on her shoulders, and moves on with the crowd, to do her share while her strength lasts, and to be cared for tenderly, I doubt not, by children and children's children when her work is done.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000304\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000304\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Another picture comes to me, too, a picture of one whose memory is an inspiring thought to the many who have the honor to call her &quot;mother.&quot; A stately old lady, left a widow many years ago, before the recent changes had wrought havoc preparatory to further progress, she seemed always to me the model of a mother of the old school.

The cemetery chapel was crowded, but a place was reserved for me, on account of special ties that bound me to the family, just behind the long line of white-robed mourners. In the Buddhist faith she had lived, and by the Buddhist ceremonial she was buried,—the chanted ritual, the gorgeously robed priests, and the heavy smell of incense in the air reminding one of a Roman Catholic ceremony. The white wooden coffin was placed upon a bier at the entrance to the chapel, and when the priests had done their work, and the ecclesiastical ceremony was over, the relatives arose, one by one, walked over to the coffin, bowed low before it, and placed a grain of incense upon the little censer that stood on a table before the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> bier, then, bowing again, retired to their places. Slowly and solemnly, from the tall soldier son, his hair already streaked with gray, to the two-year-old grandchild, all paid this last token of respect to a noble spirit; and after the relatives the guests, each in the order of rank or nearness to the deceased, stepped forward and performed the same ceremony before leaving the room. What the meaning of the rite was, I did not know, whether a worship of strange gods or no; but to me, as I performed the act, it only signified the honor in which I held the memory of a heroic woman who had done well her part in the world according to the light that God had given her.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000307\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000307\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Japanese art loves to picture the old woman with her kindly, wrinkled face, leaving out no wrinkle of them all, but giving with equal truthfulness the charm of expression that one finds in them. Long life is desired by all as passionately as by ancient Hebrew poet and psalmist, and with good reason, for only by long life can a woman attain the greatest honor and happiness. We often exclaim in impatience at the thought of the weakness and dependence of old<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> age, and pray that we may die in the fullness of our powers, before the decay of advancing years has made us a burden upon our friends. But in Japan, dependence is the lot of woman, and the dependence of old age is that which is most respected and considered. An aged parent is never a burden, is treated by all with the greatest love and tenderness; and if times are hard, and food and other comforts are scarce, the children, as a matter of course, deprive themselves and their children to give ungrudgingly to their old father and mother. Faults there are many in the Japanese social system, but ingratitude to parents, or disrespect to the aged, must not be named among them; and Young America may learn a salutary lesson by the study of the place that old people occupy in the home.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000308\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000308\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>It is not only for the women of Japan, but for the men as well, that old age is a time of peace and happiness. When a man reaches the age of fifty or thereabouts, often while apparently in the height of his vigor, he gives up his work or business and retires, leaving all the property and income to the care of his eldest son, upon whom<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> he becomes entirely dependent for his support.<a></a><$link class=\\\"fnanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000318\\\">[23]</$link> This support is never begrudged him, for the care of parents by their children is as much a matter of course in Japan as the care of children by those who give them birth. A man thus rarely makes provision for the future, and looks with scorn on foreign customs which seem to betoken a fear lest, in old age, ungrateful children may neglect their parents and cast them aside. The feeling, so strong in America, that dependence is of itself irksome and a thing to be dreaded, is altogether strange to the Japanese mind. The married son does not care to take his wife to a new and independent home of his own, and to support her and her children by his own labor or on his own income, but he takes her to his father's house, and thinks it no shame that his family live upon his parents. But in return, when the parents wish to retire from active life, the son takes upon himself ungrudgingly the burden of<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> their support, and the bread of dependence is never bitter to the parents' lips, for it is given freely. To the time-honored European belief, that a young man must be independent and enterprising in early life in order to lay by for old age, the Japanese will answer that children in Japan are taught to love their parents rather than ease and luxury, and that care for the future is not the necessity that it is in Europe and America, where money is above everything else,—even filial love. This habit of thought may account for the utter want of provision for the future, and the disregard for things pertaining to the accumulation of wealth, which often strikes curiously the foreigner in Japan. A Japanese considers his provision for the future made when he has brought up and educated for usefulness a large family of children. He invests his capital in their support and education, secure of bountiful returns in their gratitude and care for his old age. It is hard for the men of old Japan to understand the rush and struggle for riches in America,—a struggle that too often leaves not a pause for rest or quiet pleasure until sickness or death overtakes the indefatigable <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>worker. The <i>go inkyo</i><a></a><$link class=\\\"fnanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000322\\\">[24]</$link> of Japan is glad enough to lay down early in life the cares of the world, to have a few years of calm and peace, undisturbed by responsibilities or cares for outside matters. If he be an artist or a poet, he may, uninterrupted, spend his days with his beloved art. If he is fond of the ceremonial tea, he has whole afternoons that he may devote to this æsthetic repast; and even if he has none of these higher tastes, he will always have congenial friends who are ready to share the <i>saké</i> bottle, to join in a quiet smoke over the <i>hibachi</i>, or to play the deep-engrossing game of <i>go</i>, or <i>shogi</i>, the Japanese chess. To the Japanese mind, to be in the company of a few kindred souls, to spend the long hours of a summer's afternoon at the ceremonial tea party, sipping tea and conversing in a leisurely manner on various subjects, is an enjoyment second to none. A cultivated Japanese of the old times must receive an education fitting him especially<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> for such pursuits. At these meetings of friends, artistically or poetically inclined, the time is spent in making poems and exchanging wittily turned sentiments, to be read, commented on, and responded to; or in the making of drawings, with a few bold strokes of the brush, in illustration of some subject given out. Such enjoyments as these, the Japanese believe, cannot be appreciated or even understood by the practical, rush-ahead American, the product of the wonderful but material civilization of the West.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000309\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000309\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Thus, amid enjoyments and easy labors suited to their closing years, the elder couple spend their days with the young people, cared for and protected by them.

The earliest history of Japan is so wrapped in the mists of legend and tradition that only here and there do we get glimpses of heroic figures,—leaders in those early days. Demigods they seem, children of Heaven, receiving from Heaven by special revelation the wisdom or strength by means of which they conquered their enemies, or gave to their subjects new arts and better laws. The traditional emperors, the early descendants of the great Jimmu Tenno,<a></a><$link class=\\\"fnanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000357\\\">[25]</$link> seem to have been merely conquering <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>chieftains, who by virtue of their descent were regarded as divine, but who lived the simple, hardy life of the savage king, surrounded by wives and concubines, done homage to by armed retainers and subject chiefs, but living in rude huts, and moving in and out among the soldiers, not in the least retired into the mysterious solitude which in later days enveloped the Son of the Gods. The first emperors ruled not only by divine right, but by personal force and valor; and the stories of the valiant deeds of these early rulers kept strong the faith of the people in the divine qualities of the imperial house during the hundreds of years when the Emperor was a mere puppet in the hands of ambitious and powerful nobles.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000328\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000328\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Towards the end of this legendary period, a figure comes into view that for heroic qualities cannot be excelled in the annals of any nation,—Jingo Kōgō, the conqueror<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> of Corea, who alone, among the nine female rulers of Japan, has made an era in the national history. She seems to have been from the beginning, like Jeanne D'Arc, a hearer of divine voices; and through her was conveyed to her unbelieving husband a divine command, to take ship and sail westward to the conquest of an unknown land. Her husband questioned the authenticity of the message, took the earthly and practical view that, as there was no land to be seen in the westward, there could be no land there, and refused to organize any expedition in fulfillment of the command; but for his unbelief was sternly told that he should never see the land, but that his wife should conquer it for the son whom she should bear after the father's death. This message from the gods was fulfilled. The Emperor died in battle shortly after, and the Empress, after suppressing the rebellion in which her husband had been killed, proceeded to organize an expedition for the conquest of the unknown land beyond the western sea. By as many signs as those required by Gideon to assure himself of his divine mission, the Empress tested the call that had come to her, but at last, satisfied<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> that the voices were from Heaven, she gave her orders for the collection of troops and the building of a navy. I quote from Griffis the inspiring words with which she addressed her generals: &quot;The safety or destruction of our country depends upon this enterprise. I intrust the details to you. It will be your fault if they are not carried out. I am a woman and young. I shall disguise myself as a man, and undertake this gallant expedition, trusting to the gods and to my troops and captains. We shall acquire a wealthy country. The glory is yours, if we succeed; if we fail, the guilt and disgrace shall be mine.&quot; What wonder that her captains responded to such an appeal, and that the work of recruiting and shipbuilding began with a will! It was a long preparation that was required—sometimes, to the impatient woman, it seemed unnecessarily slow—but by continual prayer and offerings she appealed to the gods for aid; and at last all was ready, and the brave array of ships set sail for the unknown shore, the Empress feeling within her the new inspiration of hope for her babe as yet unborn. Heaven smiled upon them from the start. The clearest of skies, the most<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> favoring of breezes, the smoothest of seas, favored the god-sent expedition; and tradition says that even the fishes swarmed in shoals about their keels, and carried them on to their desired haven. The fleet ran safely across to southern Corea, but instead of finding battles and struggles awaiting them, the king of the country met them on the beach to receive and tender allegiance to the invaders, whose unexpected appearance from the unexplored East had led the natives to believe that their gods had forsaken them. The expedition returned laden with vast wealth, not the spoil of battle, but the peaceful tribute of a bloodless victory; and from that time forward Japan, through Corea, and later by direct contact with China itself, began to receive and assimilate the civilization, arts, and religions of China. Thus through a woman Japan received the start along the line of progress which made her what she is to-day, for the sequel of Jingo Kōgō's Corean expedition was the introduction of almost everything which we regard as peculiar to civilized countries. With characteristic belittling of the woman and exalting of the man, the whole martial career of the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> Empress is ascribed to the influence of her son as yet unborn,—a son who by his valor and prowess has secured for his deified spirit the position of God of War in the Japanese pantheon. We should say that pre-natal influences and heredity produced the heroic son; the Japanese reason from the other end, and show that all the noble qualities of the mother were produced by the influence of the unborn babe.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000329\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000329\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>With the introduction of literature, art, and Buddhism, a change took place in the relations of the court to the people. About the Emperor's throne there gathered not only soldiers and governors, but the learned, the accomplished, the witty, the artistic, who found in the Emperor and the court nobles munificent patrons by whom they were supported, and before whom they laid whatever pearls they were able to produce. The new culture sought not the clash of arms and the shout of soldiers, but the quiet and refinement of palaces and gardens far removed from the noise and clamor of the world. And while emperors sought to encourage the new learning and civilization, and to soften the warlike qualities of the people about them, there was a frontier<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> along which the savages still made raids into the territory which the Japanese had wrested from them, and which it required a strong arm and a quick hand to guard for the defense of the people. But the Emperor gradually gave up the personal leadership in war, and passed the duty of defending the nation into the hands of one or another of the great noble families. The nobles were not by any means slow to see the advantage to be gained for themselves by the possession of the military power in an age when might made right, even more than it does to-day, and when force, used judiciously and with proper deference to the prejudices of the people, could be made to give to its possessor power even over the Emperor himself. And so gradually, in the pursuit of the new culture and the new religion, the emperors withdrew themselves more and more into seclusion, and the court became a little world in itself,—a centre of culture and refinement into which few excitements of war or politics ever came. While the great nobles wrangled for the possession of the power, schemed and fought and turned the nation upside down; while the heroes of the country <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>rose, lived, fought, and died,—the Emperor, amid his ladies and his courtiers, his priests and his literary men, spent his life in a world of his own; thinking more of this pair of bright eyes, that new and charming poem, the other witty saying of those about him, than of the kingdom that he ruled by divine right; and retiring, after ten years or so of puppet kinghood, from the seclusion of his court to the deeper seclusion of some Buddhist monastery.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000330\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000330\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Within the sacred precincts of the court, much time was given to such games and pastimes as were not too rude or noisy for the refinement that the new culture brought with it.

The ladies, in trailing garments and with flowing hair, reaching often below the knees, played a not inconspicuous part, not only because of their beauty and grace, but for their quickness of wit, their learning in the classics,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> their skill in repartee, and their quaint fancies, which they embodied in poetic form.<a></a><$link class=\\\"fnanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000361\\\">[26]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000331\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000331\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Much attention was given to that harmony of art with nature that the Japanese taste makes the <i>sine qua non</i> of all true artistic effort.

The very decorations of the palace must be changed with the changing of the months; and <i>kakémono</i> and vase are alternately stored in the <i>kura</i> and brought out to decorate the room, according as their designs seem in harmony with the mood of Nature. This effort to harmonize Nature and Art is seen to-day, not only in the splendid furnishings of the court, but all through the decorative art of Japan.

The palace is built in Japanese style, surrounded by the old castle moats, but there are many foreign additions to the palace and grounds. It is heated and lighted in foreign style, and the larger rooms are all furnished after the magnificent manner of European palaces; while the lacquer work, carvings, and gorgeous paneled ceilings remind one of the finest of Japanese temples. The private apartments of the Emperor and Empress are, on the other hand, most simple, and in thorough Japanese style; and though the woodwork and polished floors of the corridors are very beautiful, the paintings and lacquer work most exquisite, <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>there is little in this simplicity to denote the abode of royalty.

There is a charity hospital in Tōkyō, having in connection with it a training school for nurses, that is one of the special objects of her care.

The public, indeed, hears with a certain listless indifference, engendered by habit, that her Majesty has visited this school, or gone round the wards at that hospital. Such incidents all seem to fall naturally into the routine of the imperial day's work. Yet to the Empress the weariness of long hours spent in classrooms or in laboratories, or by the beds of the sick, must soon become quite intolerable did she not contrive, out of the goodness of her heart, to retain a keen and kindly interest in everything that concerns the welfare of her subjects. That her Majesty does feel this interest, and that it grows rather than diminishes as the years go by, every one knows who has been present on any of the innumerable occasions when the promoters of some charity or the directors of some educational institution have presented, with merciless precision, all the petty details of their projects or organizations for the examination of the imperial lady. The latest evidence of her<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> Majesty's benevolence is, however, more than usually striking. Since the founding of the Tōkyō Charity Hospital, where so many poor women and children are treated, the Empress has watched the institution closely, has bestowed on it patronage of the most active and helpful character, and has contributed handsomely to its funds. Little by little the hospital grew, extending its sphere of action and enlarging its ministrations, until the need of more capacious premises—a need familiar to such undertakings—began to be strongly felt. The Empress, knowing this, cast about for some means of assisting this project. To practice strict economy in her own personal expenses, and to devote whatever money might thus be saved from her yearly income to the aid of the hospital, appears to have suggested itself to her Majesty as the most feasible method of procedure. The result is, that a sum of 8,446 yen, 90 sen, and 8 rin has just been handed over to Dr. Takagi, the chief promoter and mainstay of the hospital, by Viscount Kagawa, one of her Majesty's chamberlains. There is something picturesque about these sen and rin. They represent<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> an account minutely and faithfully kept between her Majesty's unavoidable expenses and the benevolent impulse that constantly urged her to curtail them. Such gracious acts of sterling effort command admiration and love.&quot;</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000344\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000344\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Not very long ago, on one of her visits to the hospital, the Empress visited the children's ward, and took with her toys, which she gave with her own hand to each child there.

The best specimens of poetry, painting, and composition done by the scholars are sent to the palace for her inspection, and some of these are kept by her in her own private rooms.

In sewing and cooking classes (for the daughters of the nobles are taught to sew and cook), she sometimes speaks to the scholars, asking them questions.

The choice usually rests with the Emperor or his advisers, and would be naturally given to the most worthy, whether in beauty or accomplishments. No doubt one reason why the Empress is regarded as far below the Emperor is, that she is not of royal blood, but one of the subjects of the Empire. In the old times, the daughters of the Emperor could never marry, as all men were far beneath them in rank. These usually devoted their lives to religion, and as Shintō priestesses or Buddhist nuns dwelt in the retirement of temple courts or the seclusion of cloisters.</p></div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000374\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000374\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000375\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000375\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000376\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000376\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000377\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000377\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\"><p><a></a><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000339\\\"><span class=\\\"label\\\">[30]</span></$link> Tokugawa Shōguns were the military rulers of the Tokugawa family, who held the power in Japan for a period of two hundred and fifty years.

The wealth of the country was in the hands of those who held the real power, and the Emperor was dependent for his support upon his great vassal, who held the land, collected the taxes, made the laws, and gave to his master whatever seemed necessary for his maintenance in the simple style of the old days, keeping for himself and for his retainers enough to make Yedo, the Tokugawa capital, the centre of a luxury far surpassing anything ever seen at the Emperor's own court. While the <i>kugé</i>, the old imperial nobility, formerly the governors of the provinces under the Emperors, lived in respectable but often extreme poverty <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>at Kyōto, the landed nobility, or daimiōs, brought, after many struggles, under the sway of the Tokugawas, built for themselves palaces and pleasure gardens in the moated city of Yedo. At Yedo with its castle, its gardens, its <i>yashikis</i>, and its fortifications, was established a new court, more luxurious, but less artistic and cultivated, than the old court of Kyōto. In the various provinces, too, at every castle town, a little court arose about the castle, and the daimiō became not only the feudal chief, but the patron of literature and art among his people, as the years went by filling his <i>kura</i> with choice works of art, in lacquer, bronze, silver, and pottery, to be brought out on special occasions. These nobles, under a law of Iyémitsŭ, the third of the Tokugawa line, were compelled to spend half of each year at the city of the Shōguns; and each had his <i>yashiki</i>, or large house and garden, in the city. At this house, his family must reside permanently, as hostages for the loyalty of their lord while away. The annual journeys to and from Yedo were events not only in the lives of the daimiōs and their trains of retainers, but in the lives of the country people who<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> lived along the roads by which they must travel. The time and style of each journey for each daimiō were rigidly prescribed in the laws of Iyémitsŭ, as well as the behavior of the country people who might meet the procession moving towards Yedo, or returning therefrom. When some noble, or any member of his family, was to pass through a certain section of the country, great preparations were made beforehand. Not only was traffic stopped along the route, but every door and window had to be closed. By no means was any one to show himself, or to look in any way upon the passing procession. To do so was to commit a profane deed, punishable by a fine. Among other things, no cooking was allowed on that day. All the food must be prepared the day before, as the air was supposed to become polluted by the smoke from the fires. Thus through crowded cities, full and busy with life, the daimiō in his curtained palanquin, with numerous retinue, would pass by; but wherever he approached, the place would be as deserted and silent as if plague-stricken. It is hardly necessary to add that these journeys, attended with so much ceremony and<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> inconvenience to the people, were not as frequent as the trips now taken, at a moment's notice, from one city to another, by these very same men.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000392\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000392\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>One story current in Tōkyō shows the narrowing effect of such seclusion.

The samurai were the learned class and the military class; they were and are the life of Japan; and it is no wonder that the nobles, protected and shielded from the world, and growing up without much education, should have changed in the course of centuries from strong, brave warriors into the delicate, effeminate, luxury-loving nobles of the present day.

In such a house as this, one finds ladies-in-waiting, of the samurai rank, who serve her ladyship—the daimiō's wife—in all personal service. In the old days, the daughters of the samurai were eager for the training in etiquette, and in all that belongs to nice housekeeping, that might be obtained by a few years of apprenticeship in a daimiō's house, and gladly assumed the most menial positions for the sake of the education and reputation to be gained by such training.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000396\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000396\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The wife and daughters of a daimiō led the quietest of lives, rarely passing beyond the four great walls that inclose the palace with its grounds.

Surrounded by endless restrictions of etiquette, lacking both the stimulus that comes from physical toil and that to be derived from intellectual exertion, the ladies of this class of the nobility simply vegetated. There is little wonder that the nobles degenerated both mentally and physically during the years when the Tokugawas held sway; for there was absolutely nothing in the lives of the women to fit them to be the wives and mothers of strong men. Delicate, dainty, refined, dexterous in all manner of little things but helpless to act for themselves,—ladies to the inmost core of their beings, with instincts of honor and of <i>noblesse oblige</i> appearing in them from earliest childhood,—the years of seclusion, of deference from hundreds of retainers, of constant instruction in the duties as well as the dignities of their position, have produced an abiding effect upon the minds of the women of this aristocracy, and to-day even the youngest and smallest of them have the virtues as well as the failings produced by nearly<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> three centuries of training. They are lacking in force, in ambition, in clearness of thought, among a nation abounding in those qualities; but the national characteristics of dignity, charming manners, a quick sense of honor, and indomitable pride of race and nation, combined with a personal modesty almost deprecating in its humility,—these are found among the daughters of the nobles developed to their highest extent. With the qualities of gentleness and delicacy possessed by these ladies, which make them shrink from rough contact with the outer world, there are mingled the stronger qualities of moral and physical courage. A daimiō's wife, as befitted the wife of a warrior and the daughter of long generations of brave men, never shrank from facing danger and death when necessary; and considered the taking of her own life an honorable and easy escape from being captured by her enemy.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000409\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000409\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Two or three little ripples from the past broke into my life in Tōkyō, giving a little insight into those old feudal times, and the customs that were common then, but that are now gone forever. A story was told me in Japan by a lady who had herself, as<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> a child, witnessed the events narrated. It illustrates the responsibility felt by the retainers for their lord and his house. A daimiō fell into disgrace with the Shōgun, and was banished to his own capital,—a castle town several days' journey from Yedo,—as a punishment for some offense. The castle gates were closed, and no communication with the outer world allowed. During this period of disgrace, it happened that the noble fell ill, and died quite suddenly before his punishment was ended. His death under such circumstances was the most terrible thing that could befall either himself or his family, as his funeral must be without the ordinary tokens of respect; and his tombstone, instead of bearing tribute to his virtues, and the favor in which he had been held by his lord, must be simply the monument of his disgrace. This being the case, the retainers felt that these evils must be averted at any cost. Knowing that the Shōgun's anger was probably not so great as to make him wish to bring eternal disgrace to their dead lord, they at once decided to send a messenger to the Shōgun, begging for pardon on the plea of desperate illness, and asking <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>the restoration of his favor before the approach of death. The death was not announced, but the floor of the room in which the man had died was lifted up, and the body let down to the ground beneath; and through all the town it was announced that the daimiō was hopelessly ill. Forty days passed before the Shōgun sent to the retainers the token that the disgrace was removed, and during all those forty days, in castle and barrack and village, the fiction of the daimiō's illness was kept up. As soon as the messengers returned, the body was drawn up again through the floor and placed on the bed; and all the retainers, from the least unto the greatest, were summoned into the room to congratulate their master upon his restoration to favor. One by one they entered the darkened room, prostrated themselves before the corpse, and uttered the formal words of congratulation. Then when all, even to the little girl who, grown to womanhood, told me the story, had been through the horrible ceremony, it was announced that the master was dead,—that he had died immediately after the return of the messenger with the good tidings of pardon.<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> All obstacles being thus removed, the funeral was celebrated with due pomp and circumstance; and the tombstone of the daimiō to-day gives no hint of the disgrace from which he so narrowly escaped.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000410\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000410\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Another instance very similar, throwing some light on the custom of adoption or <i>yōshi</i>, referred to in a previous chapter, was the case of a nobleman who died without children, and without an heir appointed to inherit his title. It would never have done, in sending in the official notice of death, to be unable to name the legal head of the house and the successor to the title. There was also no male relative to perform the office of chief mourner at the funeral; and so the death of the nobleman was kept secret, and his house showed no signs of mourning during a long period, until a son satisfactory to all the members of the household had been adopted. When the legal notice of the adoption had been sent in, and the son received into the family as heir, then, and only then, was the death of the lord announced, the period of mourning begun, and the funeral ceremony performed.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000411\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000411\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Upon one occasion I was visiting a Japanese <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>lady, who knew the interest that I took in seeing and procuring the old-fashioned embroidered <i>kimonos</i>, which are now entirely out of style in Japan, and which can only be obtained at second-hand clothing stores, or at private sale. My friend said that she had just been shown an assortment of old garments which were offered at private sale by the heirs of a lady, recently deceased, who had once been a maid of honor in a daimiō's house. The clothes were still in the house, and were brought in, in a great basket, for my inspection. Very beautiful garments they were, of silk, crêpe, and linen, embroidered elaborately, and in extremely good order. Many of them seemed not to have been worn at all, but had been kept folded away for years, and only brought out when a fitting occasion came round at the proper season of the year. As we turned over the beautiful fabrics, a black broadcloth garment at the bottom of the basket aroused my curiosity, and I pulled it out and held it up for closer inspection. A curious garment it was, bound with white, and with a great white crest <i>appliqué</i> on the middle of the back. Curious white stripes gave the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> coat a military look, and it seemed appropriate rather to the wardrobe of some two-sworded warrior than to that of a gentlewoman of the old type. To the question, How did such a coat come to be in such a place? the older lady of the company—one to whom the old days were still the natural order and the new customs an exotic growth—explained that the garment rightfully belonged in the wardrobe of any lady-in-waiting in a daimiō's house, for it was made to wear in case of fire or attack when the men were away, and the women were expected to guard the premises. Further search among the relics of the past brought to light the rest of the costume: silk <i>hakama</i>, or full kilted trousers; a stiff, manlike black silk cap bound with a white band; and a spear cover of broadcloth, with a great white crest upon it, like the one on the broadcloth coat. These made up the uniform which must be donned in time of need by the ladies of the palace or the castle, for the defense of their lord's property. They had been folded away for twenty years among the embroidered robes, to come to light at last for the purpose of showing to a foreigner a phase of the old<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> life that was so much a matter of course to the older Japanese that it never occurred to them even to mention it to a stranger. The elder lady of the house was wonderfully amused at my interest in these mute memorials of the past, and could never comprehend why I was willing to expend the sum of one dollar for the sake of gaining possession of a set of garments for which I could have no possible use. The uniform had probably never been worn in actual warfare, but its owner had been trained in the use of the long-handled spear, the cover of which she had kept stored away all these years; and had regarded herself as liable to be called into action at any time as one of the home guard, when the male retainers of her lord were in the field.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000412\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000412\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>There are in the shops of Tōkyō to-day hundreds of colored prints illustrating the splendor of the Shōgunate; for the fine clothes, the pageants, the show and display that ended with the fall of the house of Tokugawa, are still dear to the popular mind.

One sees, too, the interiors of the daimiōs' houses, the intimate domestic scenes into which no outsider could ever penetrate. One picture shows the excitements consequent upon the advent of an heir to a noble house,—the happy mother on her couch, surrounded by brightly dressed ladies-in-waiting; the baby in the room adjoining; another group of brilliant beings preparing his bath; while down the long piazza, which opens upon the little courtyard in the centre of the house, one sees still other groups of servants, bringing the gifts with which the great mansion is flooded at such a time.

There are no courts, small and great, scattered all through the country, where the ladies must be dressed in changing styles for the changing seasons, and where the embroideries that imitate most closely the natural flowers are sure of a market. When one asks, as every foreigner is likely to ask, the Japanese ladies of one's acquaintance, &quot;Why have you given up the beautiful embroideries and gorgeous colors that you used to wear?&quot; the answer always is, &quot;There are no daimiōs' houses now.&quot; And this is regarded as a sufficient explanation of the change.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000774\\\">[*]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000414\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000414\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>I have in my possession to-day two dainty bits of the silk mosaic work before mentioned, the work of the sixteen-year-old wife of one of the proudest and most conservative <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>of the present generation of nobles. A dainty little creature she was, with a face upon which her two years of wifehood and one year of motherhood had left no trace of care. Living amid her host of ladies and women servants, most of them older and wiser than herself; having no care and no amusements save the easy task of keeping herself pretty and well-dressed, and the amusement of watching her baby grow, and hearing the chance rumors that might come to her from the great new world into which her husband daily went, but with which she herself never mingled,—her days were one pleasant, monotonous round, unawakening alike either to soul or intellect. Into this life of remoteness from all that belongs to the new era, imagine the excitement produced by the advent of a foreign lady, with an educated dog, whose wonderful intelligence had been already related to her by one of her own ladies-in-waiting. I shall always believe that my invitation into that exclusive house was due largely to the reports of my dog, carried to its proprietors by one of the lady servitors who had seen him perform upon one occasion. Certain it is that<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> the first words of the little lady of the house to me were a question about the dog; and her last act of politeness to our party was a warm embrace of the handsome collie, who had given unimpeachable evidence that he understood a great deal of English,—a tongue which the daimiō himself was painfully learning. The dainty child-wife with both arms buried in the heavy ruff of the astonished dog is a picture that comes to me often, and that brings up most pathetically the monotony of an existence into which so small a thing can bring so much. The lifelike black and white silk puppy, the creeping baby doll from Kyōto, the silk mosaic box and chopstick case,—the work of my lady's delicate fingers,—are most agreeable reminders of the kindness and sweetness of the little wife, whose sixteen summers have been spent among the surroundings of thirty years ago, and who lives, like the enchanted princess of the fairy tales, wrapped about by a spell which separates her from the bustling world of to-day. The product of the past,—the daughter of the last of the Shōguns,—she dwells in her enchanted house, among the relics of a<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> past which is still the present to her and to her household. So lovely, so æsthetic, so dainty and charming seems the world into which one enters there, that one would not care to break the spell that holds it as it is, and let the girl-wife, with her gentlewomen and her kneeling servants, hurry forward into the busy, perplexing life of to-day.

Upon the samurai rested the defense of the country from enemies at home or abroad, as well as the preservation of literature and learning, and the conduct of all official business. At the time of the fall of feudalism, there were, among the thirty-four millions of Japanese, about two million samurai; and in this class, in the broadest sense of the word, must be included the daimiōs, as well as their two-sworded retainers. But as the greater among the samurai were distinguished by special class names, the word as commonly used, and as used throughout this work,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> applies to the military class, who served the Shōgun and the daimiōs, and who were supported by yearly allowances from the treasuries of their lords. These form a distinct class, actuated by motives quite different from those of the lower classes, and filling a great place in the history of the country. As the nobility, through long inheritance of power and wealth, became weak in body and mind, the samurai grew to be, more and more, not only the sword, but the brain of Japan; and to-day the great work of bringing the country out of the middle ages into the nineteenth century is being performed by the samurai more than by any other class.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000433\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000433\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>What, it may be asked, are the traits of the samurai which distinguish them, and make them such honored types of the perfect Japanese gentleman, so that to live and die worthy the name of samurai was the highest ambition of the soldier?

It is the story of a long siege, at the end of which the little garrison in the besieged castle was reduced to the last stages of endurance, though hourly expecting reinforcement. In this state of affairs, the great question is, whether to wait for the expected aid, or to surrender immediately, and the answer to the question can only be obtained through a knowledge of the enemy's strength. At this juncture, one of the samurai volunteers to steal into the camp of the besiegers, inspect their forces, and report their strength before the final decision is made. He disguises himself, and through various chances is able to penetrate, unsuspected, into the midst of the enemy's camp. He discovers that the besiegers are so weak that they cannot maintain the siege much longer, but while returning to the castle he is recognized and taken by the enemy. His captors give him one chance for escape from the horrible death of crucifixion. He is to go to the edge of the moat, and, standing on an elevated place, shout out to the soldiers<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> that they must surrender, for the forces are too strong for them. He seemingly consents to this, and, led down to the water's edge, he sees across the moat his wife and child, who greet him with demonstrations of joy. To her he waves his hand; then, bravely and loudly, so that it may be heard by friend and foe, he shouts out the true tidings, &quot;Wait for reinforcement at any cost, for the besiegers are weak and will soon have to give up.&quot; At these words his enraged enemies seize him and put him to a death of horrible torture, but he smiles in their faces as he tells them the sweetness of such a sacrifice for his master. Japanese history abounds with heroic deeds of blood displaying the indomitable courage of the samurai. In the reading of them, we are often reminded of the Spartan spirit of warfare, and samurai women are in some ways very like those Spartan mothers who would rather die than see their sons branded as cowards.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000436\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000436\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The implicit obedience which samurai gave their lords, when conflicting with feelings of loyalty to their country, often produced two opposing forces which had to be overcome.

To this day even, this feeling exists. Preference for rank or position, rather than for mere salary, remains strongly among the present generation, so that official positions are more sought after than the more lucrative occupations of trade.

Physicians did not charge for their services, but on the contrary would decline to name or even receive a compensation from those in their own clan. Patients, on their side, were too proud to accept services free, and would send to the physicians, not as pay exactly, but more as a gift or a token of gratitude, a sum of money which varied according to the means of the giver, as well as to the amount of service received. Daimiōs did not send to ask a teacher how much an hour his time was worth, and then arrange the lessons accordingly; the teacher was<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> not insulted by being expected to barter his knowledge for so much filthy lucre, but was merely asked whether his time and convenience would allow of his taking extra teaching. The request was made, not as a matter of give and take, but a favor to be granted.

The women in the daimiōs' castles who were taught fencing, drilled and uniformed, and relied upon to defend the castle in case of need, were women of this class,—women whose husbands and fathers were soldiers, and in whose veins ran the blood of generations of fighting ancestors.

A small but dangerous sword, of the finest Japanese steel, was shown us as the sword that she wore in her belt during all those days of war and tumult. &quot;Why did you wear the sword?&quot; we asked. &quot;So that I would have it if I was taken prisoner.&quot; &quot;What would you have done with it?&quot; was the next question, for we could not believe that a child of eight would undertake to defend herself against armed soldiers with that little sword. &quot;I would have killed<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> myself,&quot; was the answer, with a flash of the eye that showed her quite capable of committing the act in case of need.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000447\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000447\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the olden times, when the spirit of warfare was strong and justice but scantily administered, revenge for personal insult, or for the death of father or lord, fell upon the children, or the retainers.

There is a pathetic scene, in one of the most famous of the Japanese historical dramas, in which one seems to get the moral perspective of the ideal Japanese woman, as one cannot get it in any other way. The play is founded on the story of &quot;The Loyal Rōnins,&quot; referred to in the beginning of this chapter. The loyal rōnins are plotting to avenge the death of their<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> master upon the daimiō whose cupidity and injustice have brought it about. As there is danger of disloyalty even in their own ranks, Oishi, the leader of the dead daimiō's retainers, displays great caution in the selection of his fellow-conspirators, and practices every artifice to secure absolute secrecy for his plans. One young man, who was in disgrace with his lord at the time of his death, applies to be admitted within the circle of conspirators; but as it is suspected that he may not be true to the cause, a payment in money is exacted from him as a pledge of his honorable intentions. It is thus made his first duty to redeem his honor from all suspicion by the payment of the money, in order that he may perform his feudal obligation of avenging the death of his lord. But the young man is poor; he has married a poor girl, and has agreed to support not only his wife, but her old parents as well, and the payment is impossible for him. In this emergency, his wife, at the suggestion of her parents, proposes, as the only way, to sell herself, for a term of two years, to the proprietor of a house of pleasure, that she may by this vile servitude enable her<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> husband to escape the dishonor that must come to him if he fails to fulfill his feudal duty. Negotiations are entered into, the contract is made, and an advance payment is given which will furnish money enough for the pledge required by the conspirators. All this is done without the knowledge of the husband, lest his love for his wife and his grief for the sacrifice prevent him from accepting the only means left to prove his loyalty. The noble wife even plans to leave her home while he is away on a hunting expedition, and so spare him the pain of parting. His emotion upon learning of this venture in business is not of wrath at the disgrace that has overtaken his family, but simply of grief that his wife and her parents must make so great a sacrifice to save his honor. It is a terrible affliction, but it is not a disgrace in any way parallel to the disgrace of disloyalty to his lord. And the heroic wife, when the men come to carry her away, is upheld through all the trying farewells by the consciousness that she is making as noble a sacrifice of herself as did the wife of Yamato Daké when she leaped into the sea to avert the wrath of the sea-god from<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> her husband. The Japanese, both men and women, knowing this story and many others similar in character, can see, as we cannot from our point of view, that, even if the body be defiled, there is no defilement of the soul, for the woman is fulfilling her highest duty in sacrificing all, even her dearest possession, for the honor of her husband. It is a climax of self-abnegation that brings nothing but honor to the soul of her who reaches it. Japanese women who read this story feel profound pity for the poor wife, and a horror of a sacrifice that binds her to a life which outwardly, to the Japanese mind even, is the lowest depth a woman ever reaches. But they do not despise her for the act; nor would they refuse to receive her even were she to appear in living form to-day in any Japanese home, where, thanks to happier fortunes, such sacrifices are not demanded. Just at this point is the difference of moral perspective that foreigners visiting Japan find so hard to understand, and that leads many, who have lived in the country the longest, to believe that there is no modesty and purity among Japanese women. It is this that makes it possible for the vilest<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> of stories, and those that have the least foundation in fact, to find easy belief among foreigners, even if they be told about the purest, most high-minded, and most honorable of Japanese women. Our maidens, as they grow to womanhood, are taught that anything is better than personal dishonor, and their maidenly instincts side with the teaching. With us, a virtuous woman does not mean a brave, a heroic, an unselfish, or self-sacrificing woman, but means simply one who keeps herself from personal dishonor. Chastity is the supreme virtue for a woman; all other virtues are secondary compared with it. This is our point of view, and the whole perspective is arranged with that virtue in the foreground. Dismiss this for a moment, and consider the moral training of the Japanese maiden. From earliest youth until she reaches maturity, she is constantly taught that obedience and loyalty are the supreme virtues, which must be preserved even at the sacrifice of all other and lesser virtues. She is told that for the good of father or husband she must be willing to meet any danger, endure any dishonor, perpetrate any crime, give up any treasure. She must consider<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> that nothing belonging solely to herself is of any importance compared with the good of her master, her family, or her country. Place this thought of obedience and loyalty, to the point of absolute self-abnegation, in the foreground, and your perspective is altered, the other virtues occupying places of varying importance. Because a Japanese woman will sometimes sacrifice her personal virtue for the sake of father or husband, does it follow that all Japanese women are unchaste and impure? In many cases this sacrifice is the noblest that she believes possible, and she goes to it, as she would go to death in any dreadful form, for those whom she loves, and to whom she owes the duty of obedience. The Japanese maiden grows to womanhood no less pure and modest than our own girls, but our girls are never called upon to sacrifice their modesty for the sake of those whom they love best; nor is it expected of any woman in this country that she exist solely for the good of some one else, in whatever way he chooses to use her, during all the years of her life. Let us take this difference into our thought in forming our judgment, and let us rather seek the causes that underlie<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> the actions than pass judgment upon the actions themselves. From a close study of the characters of many Japanese women and girls, I am quite convinced that few women in any country do their duty, as they see it, more nobly, more single-mindedly, and more satisfactorily to those about them, than the women of Japan.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000453\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000453\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Many argue that the purity of Japanese women, as compared with the men, the ready obedience which they yield, their sweet characters and unselfish devotion as wives and mothers, are merely the results of the restraint under which they live, and that they are too weak to be allowed to enjoy freedom of thought and action.

Conscience seems as active, though often in a different manner, as the old-fashioned New England conscience, transmitted through the bluest of Puritan blood. And when a duty has once been recognized as<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> such, no timidity, or mortification, or fear of ridicule will prevent the performance of it. A case comes to my mind now of a young girl of sixteen, who made public confession before her schoolmates of shortcomings of which none of them knew, for the sake of easing her troubled conscience and warning her schoolmates against similar errors. The circumstances were as follows: The young girl had recently lost her grandmother, a most loving and affectionate old lady, who had taken the place of a mother to the child from her earliest infancy. In a somewhat unhappy home, the love of the old grandmother was the one bright spot; and when she was taken away, the poor, lonely child's memory recalled all of her own shortcomings to this beloved friend; and, too late to make amendment to the old lady herself, she dwelt on her own undutifulness, and decided that she must by some means do penance, or make atonement for her fault. She might, if she made a confession before her schoolmates, warn them against similar mistakes; and accordingly she prepared, for the literary society in which the girls took what part they chose, a long confession, written<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> in poetical style, and read it before her schoolmates and teachers. It was a terrible ordeal, as one could see by the blushing face and breaking voice, often choked with sobs; and when at the conclusion she urged her friends to behave in such a way to their dear ones that they need never suffer what she had had to endure since her grandmother's death, there was not a dry eye in the room, and many of the girls were sobbing aloud. It was a curious expiation and a touching one, but one not in the least exceptional or uncharacteristic of the spirit of duty that actuates the best women of the samurai class.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000455\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000455\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Here is another instance which illustrates this sense of duty, and desire of atoning for past mistakes or sins. At the time of the overthrow of the feudal system, the samurai, bred to loyalty to their own feudal superiors as their highest duty, found themselves ranged on different sides in the struggle, according to the positions in which their lords placed themselves. At the end of the struggle, those who had followed their daimiōs to the field, in defense of the Shōgunate, found that they had been fighting against the Emperor, the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> Son of Heaven himself, who had at last emerged from the seclusion of centuries to govern his own empire. Thus the supporters of the Shōgunate, while absolutely loyal to their daimiōs, had been disloyal to the higher power of the Emperor; and had put themselves in the position of traitors to their country. There was a conflict of principles there somewhat similar to that which took place in our Civil War, when, in the South, he who was true to his State became a traitor to his country, and he who was true to his country became a traitor to his State. Two ladies of the finest samurai type had, with absolute loyalty to a lost cause, aided by every means in their power in the defense of the city of Wakamatsu against the victorious forces of the Emperor. They had held on to the bitter end, and had been banished, with others of their family and clan, to a remote province, for some years after the end of the war. In 1877, eleven years after the close of the War of the Restoration, a rebellion broke out in the south which required a considerable expenditure of blood and money for its suppression. When the new war began, these two ladies presented<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> a petition to the government, in which they begged that they might be allowed to make amends for their former position of opposition to the Emperor, by going with the army to the field as hospital nurses. At that time, no lady in Japan had ever gone to the front to nurse the wounded soldiers; but to those two brave women was granted the privilege of making atonement for past disloyalty, by the exercise of the skill and nerve that they had gained in their experience of war against the Emperor, in the nursing of soldiers wounded in his defense.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000778\\\">[*]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000456\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000456\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the old days, the women of the samurai class fulfilled most nobly the duties that fell to their lot. As wives and mothers in time of peace, they performed their work faithfully in the quiet of their homes; and, their time filled with household cares, they busied themselves with the smaller duties of life. As the wives and mothers of soldiers, they cultivated the heroic spirit befitting their position, fearing no danger save such as involved disgrace. As the home-guard in time of need, they stood ready to defend their master's possessions with their own lives; as gentlewomen and<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> ladies-in-waiting at the court of the daimiō or the Shōgun, they cultivated the arts and accomplishments required for their position, and veiled the martial spirit that dwelt within them under an exterior as feminine, as gracious, as cultivated and charming, as that of any ladies of Europe or America. To-day in the new Japan, where the samurai have no longer their yearly allowance from their lords and their feudal duties, but, scattered through the whole nation, are engaged in all the arts and trades, and are infusing the old spirit into the new life, what are the women doing? As the government of the land to-day lies in the hands of the samurai men under the Emperor, so the progress of the women, the new ideas of work for women, are in the hands of the samurai women, led by the Empress. Wherever there is progress among the women, wherever they are looking about for new opportunities, entering new occupations, elevating the home, opening hospitals, industrial schools, asylums, there you will find the leading spirits always of the samurai class. In the recent changes, some of this class have risen above their former state<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> and joined the ranks of the nobility; and there the presence of the samurai spirit infuses new life into the aristocracy. So, too, the changes that have raised some have lowered others, and the samurai is now to be found in the formerly despised occupations of trade and industry, among the merchants, the farmers, the fishermen, the artisans, and the domestic servants. But wherever his lot is cast, the old training, the old ideals, the old pride of family, still keep him separate from his present rank, and, instead of pulling him down to the level of those about him, tend to raise that level by the example of honor and intelligence that he sets. The changed fortunes were not met without a murmur. Most of the outrages, the reactionary movements, the riots and inflammatory speeches and writings, that characterized the long period of disquiet following the Restoration, came from men of this class, who saw their support taken from them, leaving them unable to dig and ashamed to beg. But the greater part of them went sturdily to work, in government positions if they could get them, in the army, on the police force, on the farm, in the shop, at trades, at service,—even <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>to the humble work of wheeling a <i>jinrikisha</i>, if other honest occupation could not be found; and the women shared patiently and bravely the changed fortunes of the men, doing whatever they could toward bettering them. The samurai women to-day are eagerly working into the positions of teachers, interpreters, trained nurses, and whatever other places there are which may be honorably occupied by women. The girls' schools, both government and private, find many of their pupils among the samurai class; and their deference and obedience to their teachers and superiors, their ambition and keen sense of honor in the school-room, show the influence of the samurai feeling over new Japan. To the samurai women belongs the task—and they have already begun to perform it—of establishing upon a broader and surer foundation the position of women in their own country. They, as the most intelligent, will be the first to perceive the remedy for present evils, and will, if I mistake not, move heaven and earth, at some time in the near future, to have that remedy applied to their own case. Most of them read the literature of the day, some<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> of them in at least one language beside their own; a few have had the benefit of travel abroad, and have seen what the home and the family are in Christian lands. There is as much of the unconquerable spirit of the samurai to-day in the women as in the men; and it will not be very long before that spirit will begin to show itself in working for the establishment of their homes and families upon some stronger basis than the will of the husband and father.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000457\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000457\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000458\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000458\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><h3><span class=\\\"smcap\\\">Footnotes:</span></h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000459\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000459\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000460\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000460\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\">\\n</div></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000461\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000461\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"footnotes\\\"><div class=\\\"footnote\\\"><p><a></a><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000433\\\"><span class=\\\"label\\\">[36]</span></$link> <i>Rōnin</i> was the term applied to a samurai who had lost his master, and owed no feudal allegiance to any daimiō.

The first division of the military from the peasantry occurred in the eighth century, and since then the peculiar circumstances of each class have tended to produce quite different characteristics in persons originally of the same stock. To the soldier class have fallen learning, skill in arms and horsemanship, opportunities to rise to places of honor and power, lives free from sordid care in regard to the daily rice, and in which noble ideas of duty and loyalty can spring up and bear fruit in heroic deeds. To the peasant, tilling his little rice-field year after year, have come the heavy burdens of taxation; the grinding toil for a mere pittance of food for himself and his family; the patient bearing of all things imposed by his superiors, with<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> little hope of gain for himself, whatever change the fortunes of war may bring to those above him in the social scale. Is there wonder that, as the years have gone by, his wits have grown heavy under his daily drudgery; that he knows little and understands less of the changes that are taking place in his native land; that he is easily moved by only one thing, and that the failure of his crops, or the shortening of his returns from his land by heavier taxation? This is true of the héimin as a class: they are conservative, fearing that change will but tend to make harder a lot that is none too easy; and though peaceable and gentle usually, they may be moved to blind acts of riot and bloodshed by any political change that seems likely to produce heavier taxation, or even by a failure of their crops, when they see themselves and their families starving while the military and official classes have enough and to spare. But though, as a class, the farmers are ignorant and heavy, they are seldom entirely illiterate; and everywhere, throughout the country, one finds men belonging to this class who are well educated and have risen to positions of much responsibility <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>and power, and are able to hold their own, and think for themselves and for their brethren. From an article in the &quot;Tōkyō Mail,&quot; entitled &quot;A Memorialist of the Latter Days of the Tokugawa Government,&quot; I quote passages which show the thoughts of one of the héimin upon the condition of his own class about the year 1850.

He is unable to get any one to present his memorial to the Shōgun, so at last he stops the great lord's palanquin in the street,—an act in itself punishable with death,—and thrusts the paper forcibly into his hand.

The Japanese artisan works with patient toil, and with the skill and originality of the artist, to produce something that shall be individual and his own; not simply to make, after a pattern, some utensil or ornament for which he cares nothing, so long as a purchaser can be found for it, or an employer can be induced to pay him money for making it. It seems as easy for the Japanese to make things pretty and in good taste, even when they are cheap and only used by the poorer people, as it is for American mills and workers to turn out endless varieties of attempts at decoration,—all so hideous that a poor person must be content, either to be surrounded by the worst possible taste, or to purchase only such furnishings and utensils as are entirely without decoration of any kind. &quot;Cheap&quot; and &quot;nasty&quot; have come to be almost synonymous words with us, for the reason that taste in decoration is so rare that it commands a monopoly price, and can only be procured by the wealthy. In Japan this is not the case, for the cheapest of things may be found in graceful and artistic designs,—indeed can<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> hardly be found in any designs that are not graceful and artistic; and the poorest and commonest of the people may have about them the little things that go to cultivate the æsthetic part of human nature. It was not the costly art of Japan that interested me the most, although that is, of course, the most wonderful proof of the capacity and patience of individuals among this héimin class: but it was the common, cheap, every-day art that meets one at every turn; the love for the beautiful, in both nature and art, that belongs to the common coolie as well as to the nobleman. The cheap prints, the blue and white towels, the common teacups and pots, the great iron kettles in use over the fire in the farmhouse kitchen,—all these are things as pretty and tasteful in their way as the rich crêpes, the silver incense burners, the delicate porcelain, and the elegant lacquer that fill the storehouse of the daimiō; and they show, much more conclusively than these costlier things, the universal sense of beauty among the people.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000482\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000482\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The artisan works at his home, helped less often by hired laborers than by his own children, who learn the trade of their<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> father; and his house, though small, is clean and tasteful, with its soft mats, its dainty tea service, its little hanging scroll upon the walls, and its vase of gracefully arranged flowers in the corner; for flowers, even in winter and in the great city of Tōkyō, are so cheap that they are never beyond the reach of the poorest.

Hence it is that the Japanese laborer, who lives on a daily wage which would reduce an American or European to the verge of starvation, finds both time and money for the cultivation of that sense of beauty which is too often crushed completely out of the lower classes by the burdens of this nineteenth century civilization which they bear upon their shoulders. To the Japanese, the &quot;life is more than meat,&quot; it is beauty as well; and this love of beauty has<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> upon him a civilizing and refining effect, and makes him in many ways the superior of the American day-laborer.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000787\\\">[*]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000483\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000483\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The peasants and farmers of Japan, thrifty and hard-working as they are, are not by any means a prosperous class.

In the face of heavy taxes, the incessant toil, the frequent floods of late years, and the threatening famine, one would expect the poor peasants to be a most discouraged and unhappy class. That all this toil and anxiety does wear on them is no doubt true, but the laborers are always ready to bear submissively whatever comes, and are always hopeful and prepared to enjoy life again in happier times.

The great black cables hang in the unfinished temple to-day, a sign of the devotion of the women who spared not their chief ornament in the service of the gods in whom they still believe.

In the village homes, under the heavily thatched roofs, the constant struggle against poverty and famine will not permit the women to hold back, but they enter bravely into all the work of the men. In the rice-field the woman works side by side with the man, standing all day up to her knees in mud, her dress tucked up and her lower limbs encased in tight-fitting, blue cotton trousers, planting, transplanting, weeding, and turning over the evil-smelling mire, only to be distinguished from her husband by her broader belt tied in a bow behind. In mountain regions we meet the women climbing the steep mountain roads, pruning-hook in hand, after wood for winter fires; or descending, towards night, carrying a load that a donkey need not be ashamed of, packed on a frame attached to the shoulders, or poised lightly upon a straw mat upon the head. There is one village near Kyōto, Yasé by name, at the base of Hiyéi Zan, the historic Buddhist stronghold, where the women attain a stature and muscular development quite unique among the pigmy population of the island empire. Strong, jolly, red-cheeked<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> women they are, showing no evidence of the shrinking away with the advance of old age that is characteristic of most of their countrywomen. With their tucked-up <i>kimonos</i> and blue cotton trousers, they stride up and down the mountain, carrying the heaviest and most unwieldy of burdens as lightly and easily as the ordinary woman carries her baby. My first acquaintance with them was during a camping expedition upon the sacred mountain. I myself was carried up the ascent by two small, nearly naked, finely tattooed and moxa-scarred men; but my baggage, consisting of two closely packed hampers as large as ordinary steamer trunks, was lifted lightly to the heads of these feminine porters, and, poised on little straw pads, carried easily up the narrow trail, made doubly difficult by low-hanging branches, to the camp, a distance of three or four miles. From among these women of Yasé, on account of their remarkable physical development, have been chosen frequently the nurses for the imperial infants; an honor which the Yasé villagers duly appreciate, and which makes them bear themselves proudly among their less favored neighbors.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000488\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000488\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000489\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000489\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In other parts of the country, in the neighborhood of Nikkō, for instance, the care of the horses, mild little pack-mares that do much of the burden-bearing in those mountains, is mainly in the hands of the women.

As we journeyed up the rough mountain roads, the little girls kept along easily with the rest of the party; leading their meek, shock-headed beasts up the slippery log steps, and passing an occasional greeting with some returning pack-train,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> in which the soft black eyes and bits of red about the costume of the little grooms showed that they, too, were mountain maidens, returning fresh and happy after a two days' tramp through the rocky passes.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000490\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000490\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the districts where the silkworm is raised, and the silk spun and woven, the women play a most important part in this productive industry.

In the silk districts one finds the woman on terms of equality with the man, for she is an important factor in the wealth-producing power of the family, and is thus able to make herself felt as she cannot when her work is inferior to that of the men. As a farmer, as a groom, or as a porter, a woman is and must remain an inferior, but in the care of the silkworms, and all the tasks that belong to silk culture, she is the equal of the stronger sex.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000491\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000491\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000492\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000492\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Then, again, in the tea districts, the tea plantations are filled with young girls and old women, their long sleeves held back by a band over the shoulder, and a blue towel gracefully fastened over their heads to keep off the sun and the dust.

The attendants are usually sweet-faced, prettily dressed girls, and frequently the proprietor of the hotel is a woman. My first experience of a Japanese hotel was at Nara, anciently the capital of Japan, and now a place of resort because of its fine old temples, its Dai Butsu, and its beautiful deer park. The day's ride in <i>jinrikisha</i> from Ōsaka had brought our party in very tired, only to find that the hotel to which<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> we had telegraphed for rooms was already filled to overflowing by a daimiō and his suite. Not a room could be obtained, and we were at last obliged to walk some distance, for we had dismissed our tired <i>jinrikisha</i> men, to a hotel in the village, of which we knew nothing. What with fatigue and disappointment, we were not prepared to view the unknown hotel in a very rosy light; and when our guide pointed to a small gate leading into a minute, damp courtyard, we were quite convinced that the hardships of travel in Japan were now about to begin; but disappointment gave way to hope, when we were met at the door by a buxom landlady, whose smile was in itself a refreshment. Although we had little in the way of language in common, she made us feel at home at once, took us to her best room, sent her blooming and prettily dressed daughters to bring us tea and whatever other refreshments the mysterious appetite of a foreigner might require, and altogether behaved toward us in such motherly fashion that fatigue and gloom departed forthwith, leaving us refreshed and cheerful. Soon we began to feel rested, and our kind friend,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> seeing this, took us upon a tour around the house, in which room after room, spotless, empty, with shining woodwork and softest of mats, showed the good housekeeping of our hostess. A little garden in the centre of the house, with dwarf trees, moss-covered stones, and running water, gave it an air of coolness on the hot July day that was almost deceptive; and the spotless wash-room, with its great stone sink, its polished brass basins, its stone well-curb, half in and half out of the house, was cool and clean and refreshing merely to look at. A two days' stay in this hotel showed that the landlady was the master of the house. Her husband was about the house constantly, as were one or two other men, but they all worked under the direction of the energetic head of affairs. She it was who managed everything, from the cooking of the meals in the kitchen to the filling and heating of the great bath-tub into which the guests were invited to enter every afternoon, one after the other, in the order of their rank. On the second night of my stay, at a late hour, when I supposed that the whole house had retired to rest, I crept softly out of my room to try to soothe the plaintive<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> wails of my dog, who was complaining bitterly that he was made to sleep in the wood-cellar instead of in his mistress's room, as his habit had always been. As I stole quietly along, fearing lest I should arouse the sleeping house, I heard the inquiring voice of my landlady sound from the bath-room, the door of which stood wide open. Afraid that she would think me in mischief if I did not show myself, I went to the door, to find her, after her family was safely stowed away for the night, taking her ease in the great tub of hot water, and so preparing herself for a sound, if short, night's sleep. She accepted my murmured <i>Inu</i> (dog) as an excuse, and graciously dismissed me with a smile, and I returned to my room feeling safe under the vigilant care that seemed to guard the house by night as well as by day. I have seen many Japanese hotels and many careful landladies since, but no one among them all has made such an impression as my pleasant hostess at Nara.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000494\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000494\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Not only hotels, but little tea-houses all through Japan, form openings for the business abilities of women, both in country and city.

Sometimes it is quite an extensive restaurant, with several rooms for the entertainment of guests, and a regular kitchen where fairly elaborate cooking can be done; sometimes it is only a rough shelter, at one end of which water is kept boiling over a charcoal brazier, while at the other end a couple of seats, covered with mats or a scarlet blanket or two, serve as resting-places for the patrons of the establishment. But whatever the place is, there will be one woman or more in attendance; and if you sit down upon the mats, you will be served at once with tea, and later, should you require more, with whatever the establishment can afford,—it may be only a slice of watermelon, or a hard pear; it may be eels on rice, vermicelli, egg soup, or a regular dinner, should the tea-house be one of the larger and more elaborately appointed ones. When the feast is over, the refreshments you have especially ordered are paid for in the regular way; but for the tea and sweetmeats offered, for which no especial charge is made, you are expected to leave a small sum as a present. In the less aristocratic<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> resting-places, a few cents for each person is sufficient to leave on the waiter with the empty cups of tea, for which loud and grateful thanks will be shouted out to the retiring party.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000495\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000495\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the regular inn, the <i>chadai</i><a></a><$link class=\\\"fnanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000512\\\">[41]</$link> amounts to several dollars, for a party remaining any time, and it is supposed to pay for all the extra services and attention bestowed on guests by the polite host and hostess and the servants in attendance. The <i>chadai</i>, done up neatly in paper, with the words <i>On chadai</i> written on it, is given with as much formality as any present in Japan. The guest claps his hands to summon the maid. When it is heard, for the thin paper walls of a Japanese house let through every noise, voices from all sides will shout out <i>Hē´-hē´</i>, or <i>Hai</i>, which means that you have been heard, and understood. Presently a maid will softly open your door, and with head low down will ask what you wish. You tell her to summon the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> landlord. In a few moments he appears, and you push the <i>chadai</i> to him, making some conventional self-depreciating speech, as, &quot;You have done a great deal for our comfort, and we wish to give you this <i>chadai</i>, though it is only a trifle.&quot; The landlord, with every expression of surprise, will bow down to the ground with thanks, raising the small package to his head in token of acceptance and gratitude, and will murmur in low tones how little he has done for the comfort of his guests; and then, the self-depreciation and formal words of thanks on his side being ended, he will finally go down stairs to see how much he has gotten. But, whether more or less than he had expected, nothing but extreme gratitude and politeness appears on his face as he presents a fan, confectionery, or some trifle, as a return for the <i>chadai</i>, and speeds the parting guests with his lowest bow and kindliest smile, after having seen to every want that could be attended to.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000496\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000496\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Once, at Nikkō, I started with a friend for a morning walk to a place described in the guide-book. The day was hot and the guide-book hazy, and we lost the road to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> the place for which we had set out, but found ourselves at last in a beautiful garden, with a pretty lake in its centre, a little red-lacquered shrine reflected in the lake, and a tea-house hospitably open at one side. The teakettle was boiling over the little charcoal fire; melons, eggs, and various unknown comestibles were on the little counter; but no voice bade us welcome as we approached, and when we sat down on the edge of the piazza, we could see no one within the house. We waited, however, for the day was hot, and time is not worth much in rural Japan. Pretty soon a small, wizened figure made its appearance in the distance, hurrying and talking excitedly as it came near enough to see two foreign ladies seated upon the piazza. Many bows and profuse apologies were made by the little old woman, who seemed to be the solitary occupant of the pretty garden, and who had for the moment deserted her post to do the day's marketing in the neighboring village. The apologies having been smilingly received, the old lady set herself to the task of making her guests comfortable. First she brought two tumblers of water, cold as ice,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> from the spring that gushed out of a great rock in the middle of the little lake. Then she retired behind a screen and changed her dress, returning speedily to bring us tea. Then she retreated to her diminutive kitchen, and presently came back smiling, bearing eight large raw potatoes on a tray. These she presented to us with a deep bow, apparently satisfied that she had at last brought us something we would be sure to like. We left the potatoes behind us when we went away, and undoubtedly the old lady is wondering still over the mysterious ways of the foreigners, as we are over those of the Japanese tea-house keepers.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000497\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000497\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>One summer, when I was spending a week at a Japanese hotel at quite a fashionable seaside resort, I became interested in a little old woman who visited the hotel daily, carrying, suspended by a yoke from her shoulders, two baskets of fruit, which she sold to the guests of the hotel. As I was on the ground floor, and my room was, in the daytime, absolutely without walls on two sides, she was my frequent visitor, and, for the sake of her pleasant ways and cheerful smiles, I bought enough hard<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> pears of her to have given the colic to an elephant. One day, after her visit to me, as I was sitting upon the matted and roofed square that served me for a room, my eye wandered idly toward the bathing beach, and, under the slight shelter where the bathers were in the habit of depositing their sandals and towels, I spied the well-known yoke and fruit baskets, as well as a small heap of blue cotton garments that I knew to be the clothing of the little fruit-vender. She had evidently taken a moment when trade was slack to enjoy a dip in the soft, blue, summer sea. Hardly had I made up my mind as to the meaning of the fruit baskets and the clothing, when our little friend herself emerged from the sea and, sitting down on a bench, proceeded to rub herself off with the small but artistically decorated blue towel that every peasant in Japan has always with him, however lacking he may be in all other appurtenances of the toilet. As she sat there, placidly rubbing away, a friend of the opposite sex made his appearance on the scene. I watched to see what she would do, for the Japanese code of etiquette is quite different from ours in such<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> a predicament. She continued her employment until he was quite close, showing no unseemly haste, but continuing her polishing off in the same leisurely manner in which she had begun it; then at the proper moment she rose from her seat, bowed profoundly, and smilingly exchanged the greetings proper for the occasion, both parties apparently unconscious of any lack in the toilet of the lady. The male friend then passed on about his business; the little woman completed her toilet without further interruptions, shouldered her yoke, and jogged cheerfully on to her home in the little village, a couple of miles away.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000498\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000498\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>As one travels through rural Japan in summer and sees the half-naked men, women, and children that pour out from every village on one's route and surround the <i>kuruma</i> at every stopping place, one sometimes wonders whether there is in the country any real civilization, whether these half-naked people are not more savage than civilized; but when one finds everywhere good hotels, scrupulous cleanliness in all the appointments of toilet and table, polite and careful service, honest and willing performance of labor bargained for, together<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> with the gentlest and pleasantest of manners, even on the part of the gaping crowd that shut out light and air from the traveling foreigner who rests for a moment at the village inn, one is forced to reconsider a judgment formed only upon one peculiarity of the national life, and to conclude that there is certainly a high type of civilization in Japan, though differing in many important particulars from our own. A careful study of the Japanese ideas of decency, and frequent conversation with refined and intelligent Japanese ladies upon this subject, has led me to the following conclusion. According to the Japanese standard, any exposure of the person that is merely incidental to health, cleanliness, or convenience in doing necessary work, is perfectly modest and allowable; but an exposure, no matter how slight, that is simply for show, is in the highest degree indelicate. In illustration of the first part of this conclusion, I would refer to the open bath-houses, the naked laborers, the exposure of the lower limbs in wet weather by the turning up of the <i>kimono</i>, the entirely nude condition of the country children in summer, and the very slight clothing <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>that even adults regard as necessary about the house or in the country during the hot season. In illustration of the last part, I would mention the horror with which many Japanese ladies regard that style of foreign dress which, while covering the figure completely, reveals every detail of the form above the waist, and, as we say, shows off to advantage a pretty figure. To the Japanese mind it is immodest to want to show off a pretty figure. As for the ball-room costumes, where neck and arms are freely exposed to the gaze of multitudes, the Japanese woman, who would with entire composure take her bath in the presence of others, would be in an agony of shame at the thought of appearing in public in a costume so indecent as that worn by many respectable American and European women. Our judgment would indeed be a hasty one, should we conclude that the sense of decency is wanting in the Japanese as a race, or that the women are at all lacking in the womanly instinct of modesty. When the point of view from which they regard these matters is once obtained, the apparent inconsistencies and incongruities are fully explained, <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>and we can do justice to our Japanese sister in a matter in regard to which she is too often cruelly misjudged.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000499\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000499\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>There seems no doubt at all that among the peasantry of Japan one finds the women who have the most freedom and independence. Among this class, all through the country, the women, though hard-worked and possessing few comforts, lead lives of intelligent, independent labor, and have in the family positions as respected and honored as those held by women in America.

The employment of the merchant being formerly the lowest of respectable callings, one does not find even yet in Japan many great stores or a very high standard of business morality, for the business of the country was left in the hands of those who were too stupid or too unambitious to raise themselves above that social class. Hence English and American merchants, who only see Japan from the business side, continually speak of the Japanese as dishonest, tricky, and altogether unreliable, and greatly prefer to deal with the Chinese, who have much of the business virtue that is characteristic of the English as a nation. Only within a<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> few years have the samurai, or indeed any one who was capable of figuring in any higher occupation in life, been willing to adopt the calling of the merchant; but many of the abler Japanese of to-day have begun to see that trade is one of the most important factors of a nation's well-being, and that the business of buying and selling, if wisely and honestly done, is an employment that nobody need be ashamed to enter. There are in Japan a few great merchants whose word may be trusted, and whose obligations will be fulfilled with absolute honesty; but a large part of the buying and selling is still in the hands of mercantile freebooters, who will take an advantage wherever it is possible to get one, in whose morality honesty has no place, and who have not yet discovered the efficacy of that virtue simply as a matter of policy. Their trade, conducted in a small way upon small means, is more of the nature of a game, in which one person is the winner and the other the loser, than a fair exchange, in which both parties obtain what they want. It is the mediæval, not the modern idea of business, that is still held among Japanese merchants. With<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> them, trade is a warfare between buyer and seller, in which every man must take all possible advantage for himself, and it is the lookout of the other party if he is cheated.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000518\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000518\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In Tōkyō, the greatest and most modernized of the cities of the empire, the shops are not the large city stores that one sees in European and American cities, but little open-fronted rooms, on the edge of which one sits to make one's purchases, while the proprietor smiles and bows and dickers; setting his price by the style of his customer's dress, or her apparent ignorance of the value of the desired article.

He sets his great bundle carefully down on the floor, opens the enormous <i>furushiki</i>, or bundle handkerchief, in which it is enveloped, and takes out roll after roll of silk or chintz, neatly done up in paper or yellow cotton.

Like all things else in Japan, shopping takes plenty of time. At Mitsui's, the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> largest silk store in Tōkyō, one will see crowds of clerks sitting upon the matted floors, each with his <i>soroban</i>, or adding machine, by his side; and innumerable small boys, who rush to and fro, carrying armfuls of fabrics to the different clerks, or picking up the same fabrics after the customer who has called for them has departed. The store appears, to the foreign eye, to be simply a roofed and matted platform upon which both clerks and customers sit. This platform is screened from the street by dark blue cotton curtains or awnings hung from the low projecting eaves of the heavy roof. As the customers take their seats, either on the edge of the platform, or, if they have come on an extended shopping bout, upon the straw mat of the platform itself, a small boy appears with tea for the party; an obsequious clerk greets them with the customary salutations of welcome, pushes the charcoal brazier toward them, that they may smoke, or warm their hands, before proceeding to business, and then waits expectantly for the name of the goods that his customers desire to see. When this is given, the work begins; the little boys are summoned,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> and are soon sent off to the great fire-proof warehouse, which stands with heavy doors thrown open, on the other side of the platform, away from the street. Through the doorway one can see endless piles of costly stuffs stored safely away, and from these piles the boys select the required fabric, loading themselves down with them so that they can barely stagger under the weights that they carry. As the right goods are not always brought the first time, and as, moreover, there is an endless variety in the colors and patterns in even one kind of silk, there is always plenty of time for watching the busy scene,—for sipping tea, or smoking a few whiffs from the tiny pipes that so many Japanese, both men and women, carry always with them. When the purchase is at last made, there is still some time to be spent by the customer in waiting until the clerk has made an abstruse calculation upon his <i>soroban</i>, the transaction has been entered in the books of the firm, and a long bill has been written and stamped, and handed to her with the bundle.

When she herself is at last ready to leave, a chorus of yells arises, this time for her benefit; and as she skips into the <i>jinrikisha</i> and is whirled away, she hears continued the busy hum of voices, the clattering of <i>sorobans</i>, the thumping of the bare feet of the heavily laden boys, and the loud shouts of thanks with which departing guests are honored.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000521\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000521\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>There is less pomp and circumstance about the smaller stores, for all the goods are within easy reach, and the shops for household utensils and chinaware seem to have nearly the whole stock in trade piled up in front, or even in the street itself.<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> Many such little places are the homes of the people who keep them.

The hard, confining factory life, with its never-ceasing roar of machinery, bewildering the minds and intellects of the men who come under its deadening influences, until they become scarcely more than machines themselves, is a thing as yet almost unknown in Japan. The life of the <i>jinrikisha</i> man even, hard and comfortless as it may seem to run all day like a horse through the crowded city streets, is one that keeps him in the fresh air, under the open sky, and quickens his powers both of body and mind.

Very often there is a magnificent display of young trees, potted plants, and flowers, brought in from the country and ranged on both sides of the street. Here the gardeners make lively sales, as the displays are often fine in themselves, and show to a special advantage in the flaring torchlight. The eager venders, who do all they can to call the attention of the crowd to their wares, make many good bargains. The purchase requires skill on both sides, for flower men are proverbial in their high charges, asking often five and ten times the real value of a plant, but coming down in price almost immediately on remonstrance. You ask the price of a dwarf wistaria growing in a pot. The man answers at once, &quot;Two dollars.&quot; &quot;Two dollars!&quot; you answer in surprise, &quot;it is not worth more than thirty or forty cents.&quot; &quot;Seventy-five, then,&quot; he will respond; and thus the buyer and seller approach nearer in price, until the bargain is struck somewhere near the first price offered.

Some of the booths are devoted to dolls; others to toys of various kinds; still others to birds in cages, goldfish in globes, queer chirping insects in wicker baskets, pretty ornaments for the hair, fans, candies, and cakes of all sorts, roasted beans and peanuts, and other things too numerous to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> mention. The long line of stalls ends with booths, or tents, in which shows of dancing, jugglery, educated animals, and monstrosities, natural or artificial, may be seen for the moderate admission fee of two sen. Each of these shows is well advertised by the beating of drums, by the shouting of doorkeepers, by wonderful pictures on the outside to entice the passer-by, or even by an occasional brief lifting of the curtains which veil the scene from the crowd without, just long enough to afford a tantalizing glimpse of the wonders within. Great is the fascination to the children in all these things, and the little feet are never weary until the last booth is passed, and the quiet of neighboring streets, lighted only by wandering lanterns, strikes the home-returning party by its contrast with the light and noise of the festival. The supposed object of the expedition, the visit to the temple, has occupied but a small share of time and attention, and the little hands are filled with the amusing toys and trifles bought, and the little minds with the merry sights seen.

These <i>matsuri</i> last for several days, and during that time the quarter of the city in which they occur seems entirely given over to festivity. The streets are gayly decorated with flags, and bright lanterns—all alike in design and color—are hung in rows from the low eaves of the houses.

It takes a day or two for the rejoicings to get fully under way, but by the second or third day the fun is at its height, and the streets are thronged with merrymakers. A great deal of labor and strength, as well as ingenuity, is spent in the construction of enormous floats, or <i>dashi</i>, lofty platforms of two stories, either set on wheels and drawn by black bullocks or crowds of shouting men, or carried by poles on men's shoulders. Upon the first floor of these great floats is usually a company of dancers, or mummers, who dance, attitudinize, or make faces for the amusement of the crowds that gather along their route; while up above, an effigy of some hero in Japanese history, or the figure of some animal or monster, looks down unmoved upon the absurdities below. Each <i>dashi</i> is attended, not only by the men who draw it, but by companies of others in some uniform costume; and sometimes graceful professional<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> dancing-girls are hired to march in the <i>matsuri</i> procession, or to dance upon the lofty <i>dashi</i>. At the time of the festivities which accompanied the promulgation of the Constitution, three days of jollification were held in Tōkyō, days of such universal fun and frolic that it will be known among the common people, to all succeeding generations, as the &quot;Emperor's big <i>matsuri</i>.&quot; Every quarter of the city vied with every other in the production of gorgeous <i>dashi</i>, and the streets were gay with every conceivable variety of decoration, from the little red-and-white paper lanterns, that even the poorest hung before their houses, to the great evergreen arches, set with electric lights, with which the great business streets were spanned thickly from end to end. An evening walk through one of these thoroughfares was a sight to be remembered for a lifetime. The magnificent <i>dashi</i> represented all manner of quaint conceits. A great bivalve drawn by yelling crowds—which halted occasionally—opened and displayed between its shells a group of beautifully dressed girls, who danced one of the pantomimic dances of the country, accompanied by the twanging<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> melodies of the <i>samisen</i>. Then slowly the great shell closed, once more the shouting crowds seized hold of the straining ropes, and the great bivalve with its fair freight was drawn slowly along through the gayly illuminated streets. Jimmu Tenno and other heroes of Japanese legend or history, each upon its lofty platform, a white elephant, and countless other subjects were represented in the festival cars sent forth by all the districts of the city to celebrate the great event.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000527\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000527\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Upon such festival occasions the shopkeeper does not put up his shutters and leave his place of business, but the open shop-fronts add much to the gay appearance of the street.

The fortune-teller revealed to her the fact that two occult forces were at work bringing evil upon the house. One was the evil spirit of a spring or well that had been choked with stones, or otherwise obstructed in its flow, and that chose this way of bringing its afflictions to the attention of mortals.<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> The other was the spirit of a horse that had once belonged in the family, and that after death revenged itself upon its former masters for the hard service wherewith it had been made to serve. The only way in which these two powers could be appeased would be by finding the well, and removing the obstructions that choked it, and by erecting an image of the horse and offering to it cakes and other meat-offerings. The fortune-teller hinted, moreover, that for a consideration he might be able to afford material aid in the search for the well.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000536\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000536\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>At this information Go Inkyo Sama was much perturbed, for further aid for her afflicted family seemed to require the use of money, and of that commodity she had very little, being mainly dependent upon her brother for support. She returned to her home and consulted the servants upon the matter; but though they quite agreed with her that something should be done, they had little capital to invest in the enterprises suggested by the fortune-teller. At last, the old lady went to her brother, but he only laughed at her well-meant attempts to help his family, and refused to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> give her money for such a purpose. She retired discouraged, but, urged by the servants, she decided to make a last appeal, this time to her sister-in-law, who must surely be moved by the evil that was threatening herself and her children. Taking some of the head servants with her, she went to her sister and presented the case. This was her last resort, and she clung to her forlorn hope longer than many would have done, the servants adding their arguments to her impassioned appeals, only to find out after all that the steadfast sister could not be moved, and that she would not propitiate the horse's spirit, or allow money to be used for such a purpose. She gave it up then, and sat down to await the fate of her doomed house, doubtless wondering much and sighing often over the foolish skepticism of her near relatives, and wishing that the rationalistic tendencies of the time would take a less dangerous form than the neglecting of the plainest precautions for life and health. The fate has not yet come, and now at last Go Inkyo Sama seems to have resigned herself to the belief that it has been averted from the heads of the dear ones by a power unknown to the fortune-teller.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000537\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000537\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000538\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000538\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Beside these callings, there are other employments which are not regarded as wholly respectable by either Japanese or foreigners. The <i>géisha ya</i>, or establishments where dancing-girls are trained, and let out by the day or evening to tea-houses or private parties, are usually managed by women. At these establishments little girls are taken, sometimes by contract with their parents, sometimes adopted by the proprietors of the house, and from very early youth are trained not only in the art of dancing, but are taught singing and <i>samisen</i>-playing, all the etiquette of serving and entertaining guests, and whatever else goes to make a girl charming to the opposite sex. When thoroughly taught, they form a valuable investment, and well repay the labor spent upon them, for a popular géisha commands a good price everywhere, and has her time overcrowded with engagements. A Japanese entertainment is hardly regarded as complete without géishas in attendance, and their dancing, music, and graceful service at supper form a charming addition to an evening of enjoyment at a tea-house. It is these géishas, too, who at <i>matsuri</i> are hired to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> march in quaint uniforms in the procession, or, borne aloft on great <i>dashi</i>, dance for the benefit of the admiring crowds.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000539\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000539\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The Japanese dances are charmingly graceful and modest; the swaying of the body and limbs, the artistic management of the flowing draperies, the variety of themes and costumes of the different dances, all go to make an entertainment by géishas one of the pleasantest of Japanese enjoyments. Sometimes, in scarlet and yellow robes, the dainty maidens imitate, with their supple bodies, the dance of the maple leaves as they are driven hither and thither in the autumn wind; sometimes, with tucked-up <i>kimonos</i> and jaunty red petticoats, they play the part of little country girls carrying their eggs to market in the neighboring village. Again, clad in armor, they simulate the warlike gestures and martial stamp of some of the old-time heroes; or, with whitened faces and hoary locks, they perform with rake and broom the dance of the good old man and old woman who play so prominent a part in Japanese pictures. And then, when the dance is over, and all are bewitched with their grace and beauty, they descend to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> the supper-room and ply their temporary employers with the <i>saké</i> bottle, laughing and jesting the while, until there is little wonder if the young men at the entertainment drink more than is good for them, and leave the tea-house at last thoroughly tipsy, and enslaved by the bright eyes and merry wits of some of the Hebes who have beguiled them through the evening.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000540\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000540\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The géishas unfortunately, though fair, are frail. In their system of education, manners stand higher than morals, and many a géisha gladly leaves the dancing in the tea-houses to become the concubine of some wealthy Japanese or foreigner, thinking none the worse of herself for such a business arrangement, and going cheerfully back to her regular work, should her contract be unexpectedly ended. The géisha is not necessarily bad, but there is in her life much temptation to evil, and little stimulus to do right, so that, where one lives blameless, many go wrong, and drop below the margin of respectability altogether. Yet so fascinating, bright, and lively are these géishas that many of them have been taken by men of good position as wives, and are now the heads of<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> the most respectable homes. Without true education or morals, but trained thoroughly in all the arts and accomplishments that please,—witty, quick at repartee, pretty, and always well dressed,—the géisha has proved a formidable rival for the demure, quiet maiden of good family, who can only give her husband an unsullied name, silent obedience, and faithful service all her life. The freedom of the present age, as shown in the chapter on &quot;Marriage and Divorce,&quot; and as seen in the choice of such wives, has presented this great problem to the thinking women of Japan. If the wives of the leaders in Japan are to come from among such a class of women, something must be done, and done quickly, for the sake of the future of Japan; either to raise the standards of the men in regard to women, or to change the old system of education for girls. A liberal education, and more freedom in early life for women, has been suggested, and is now being tried, but the problem of the géisha and her fascination is a deep one in Japan.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000541\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000541\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Below the géisha in respectability stands the jōrō, or licensed prostitute. Every<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> city in Japan has its disreputable quarter, where the various <i>jōrōya</i>, or licensed houses of prostitution, are situated. The supervision that the government exercises over these places is extremely rigid; the effort is made, by licensing and regulating them, to minimize the evils that must flow from them. The proprietors of the <i>jōrōya</i> do everything in their power to make their houses, grounds, and employees attractive, and, to the unsuspecting foreigner, this portion of the city seems often the pleasantest and most respectable. A jōrō need never be taken for a respectable woman, for her dress is distinctive, and a stay of a short time in Japan is long enough to teach even the most obtuse that the <i>obi</i>, or sash, tied in front instead of behind, is one of the badges of shame. But though the occupation of the jōrō is altogether disreputable,—though the prostitute quarter is the spot to which the police turn for information in regard to criminals and law-breakers, a sort of a trap into which, sooner or later, the offender against the law is sure to fall,—Japanese public opinion, though recognizing the evil as a great one, does not look upon the professional prostitute <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>with the loathing which she inspires in Christian countries. The reason for this lies, not solely in the lower moral standards although it is true that sins of this character are regarded much more leniently in Japan than in England or America. The reason lies very largely in the fact that these women are seldom free agents. Many of them are virtually slaves, sold in childhood to the keepers of the houses in which they work, and trained, amid the surroundings of the <i>jōrōya</i>, for the life which is the only life they have ever known. A few may have sacrificed themselves freely but reluctantly for those whom they love, and by their revolting slavery may be earning the means to keep their dear ones from starvation or disgrace. Many are the Japanese romances that are woven about the virtuous jōrō, who is eventually rewarded by finding, even in the <i>jōrōya</i>, a lover who is willing to raise her again to a life of respectability, and make her a happy wife and the mother of children. Such stories must necessarily lower the standard of morals in regard to chastity, but in a country in which innocent romance has little room for development, the imagination <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>must find its materials where it can. These <i>jōrōya</i> give employment to thousands of women throughout the country, but in few cases do the women seek that employment, and more openings in respectable directions, together with a change in public opinion securing to every woman the right to her own person, would tend to diminish the number of victims that these institutions yearly draw into their devouring current.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000542\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000542\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Innocent and reputable amusements are many and varied in the cities. We have already mentioned incidentally the theatre as one of the favorite diversions of the people; and though it has never been regarded as a very refined amusement, it has done and is doing much for the education of the lower classes in the history and spirit of former times. Regular plays were never performed in the presence of the Emperor and his court, or the Shōgun and his nobles, but the <i>No</i> dance was the only dramatic amusement of the nobility. This <i>No</i> is an ancient Japanese theatrical performance, more, perhaps, like the Greek drama than anything in our modern life. All the movements of the actors are measured <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>and conventionalized, speech is a poetical recitative, the costumes are stiff and antique, masks are much used, and a chorus seated upon the stage chants audible comments upon the various situations.

As the performances last all day, from ten or eleven in the forenoon until eight or nine in the evening, going to the theatre means much more than a few hours of entertainment after the day's work is over. A lunch and dinner, with innumerable light edibles between, go to make up the usual bill of fare for a day at the play, and tea-houses in the neighborhood of the theatre provide the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> necessary meals, a room to take them in, a resting-place between the acts, and whatever tea, cakes, and other refreshments may be ordered.

Many charming tales are told of old Japan, and even Western stories have found their way to these assemblies. A long story is often continued from night to night until finished.

The river Sumida, on which Tōkyō is situated, has lining its eastern shore for some miles the famous cherry-trees of Japan, with their large, double pink blossoms, and when, in April and May, these flowers are in their perfection, great crowds of sightseers flock to Mukōjima to enjoy the blossoms under the trees. The river is crowded with picnic parties in boats. Every tea-house along the banks is full of guests, and the little stalls and resting-places on the way find a<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> quick sale for fruit, confectionery, and light lunches. <i>Saké</i> is often too freely imbibed by the merrymakers, whose flushed faces show, when returning homeward, how their day was spent. There is much quiet enjoyment, too, of the lovely blossoms, the broad, calm river, and the gayly dressed crowds. Hundreds and thousands of visitors crowd to the suburban places about Tōkyō,—to Uyéno Park for its cherry and peach blossoms, Kaméido for the plum and wistaria, Oji for its famous maple-trees, and many others, each noted for some special beauty. Dango Zaka has its own peculiar attraction, the famous chrysanthemum dolls. These ingenious figures are arranged so as to form tableaux,—scenes from history or fiction well known to all the people. They are of life size, and the faces, hands, and feet are made of some composition, and closely resemble life in every detail. But the curious thing in these tableaux is that the scenery, whether it be the representation of a waterfall, rocks, or bushes, the animals, and the dresses of the figures are made entirely of chrysanthemum twigs, leaves, and flowers, not cut and woven in, as at the first glance they<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> seem to be,—so closely are the leaves and flowers bound together to make the flat surface of different objects,—but alive and growing on the plants. It is impossible to tell where the roots and stems are hidden, for nothing is visible but (for example) the white spray and greenish shadows of a waterfall, or the parti-colored figures in a young girl's dress. But, should it be the visitor's good fortune to watch the repairing of one of these lifelike images, he will find that the entire body is a frame woven of split bamboo, within which the plants are placed, their roots packed in damp earth and bound about with straw, while their leaves and flowers are pulled through the basket frame and woven into whatsoever pattern the artistic eye and skillful fingers of the gardener may select.

There is a freedom in their relations with the families that they serve, that in this country would be regarded as impudence, and an independence of action that, in many cases, seems to take the form of direct disobedience to orders. From the steward of your household, who keeps your accounts, makes your purchases, and manages your affairs, to your <i>jinrikisha</i> man or groom, every servant in your establishment does what is right in his own eyes, and after the manner that he thinks best. Mere blind obedience to orders is not regarded as a virtue in a Japanese servant; he must do his own thinking, and, if he cannot grasp the reason for your order, that order will not be carried out. Housekeeping in Japan is frequently the despair of the thrifty<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> American housewife, who has been accustomed in her own country to be the head of every detail of household work, leaving to her servants only the mechanical labor of the hands. She begins by showing her Oriental help the work to be done, and just the way in which she is accustomed to having it done at home, and the chances are about one in a hundred that her servant will carry out her instructions. In the ninety-nine other cases, he will accomplish the desired result, but by means totally different from those to which the American housekeeper is accustomed. If the housewife is one of the worrying kind, who cares as much about the way in which the thing is done as about the accomplished result, the chances are that she will wear herself out in a fruitless endeavor to make her servants do things in her own way, and will, when she returns to America, assure you that Japanese servants are the most idle, stupid, and altogether worthless lot that it was ever her bad fortune to have to do with. But on the other hand, if the lady of the house is one who is willing to give general orders, and then sit down and wait until the work is done before criticising <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>it, she will find that by some means or other the work will be accomplished and her desire will be carried out, provided only that her servants see a reason for getting the thing done. And as she finds that her domestics will take responsibility upon themselves, and will work, not only with their hands, but with the will and intellect in her service, she soon yields to their protecting and thoughtful care for herself and her interests, and, when she returns to America, is loud in her praises of the competence and devotion of her Japanese servants. Even in the treaty ports, where contact with foreigners has given to the Japanese attendants the silent and repressed air that we regard as the standard manner for a servant, they have not resigned their right of private judgment, but, if faithful and honest, seek the best good of their employer, even if his best good involves disobedience of his orders. This characteristic of the Japanese servant is aggravated when he is in the employment of foreigners, for the simple reason that he is apt to regard the foreigner as a species of imbecile, who must be cared for tenderly because he is quite incompetent to care for<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> himself, but whose fancies must not be too much regarded. Of the relations of foreign employers and Japanese servants much might be said, but our business is with the position of the servants in a Japanese household.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000558\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000558\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Under the old feudal system, the servants of every family were its hereditary retainers, and from generation to generation desired no higher lot than personal service in the family to which they belonged. The principle of loyalty to the family interests was the leading principle in the lives of the servants, just as loyalty to the daimiō was the highest duty of the samurai. Long and intimate knowledge of the family history and traits of character rendered it possible for the retainer to work intelligently for his master, and do independently for him many things without orders. The servant in many cases knew his master and his master's interests as well as the master himself, or even better, and must act by the light of his own knowledge in cases where his master was ignorant or misinformed. One can easily see how ties of good-fellowship and sympathy would arise between masters and servants, how a community <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>of interest would exist, so that the good of the master and his family would be the condition for the good of the servant and his family. In America, where the relation between servant and employer is usually a simple business arrangement, each giving certain specified considerations and nothing more, the relation of servant to master is shorn of all sentiment and affection; the servant's interests are quite apart from those of his employer, and his main object is to get the specified work done and obtain more time for himself, and sooner or later to leave the despised occupation of domestic service for some higher and more independent calling. In Japan, where faithful service of a master was regarded as a calling worthy of absorbing any one's highest abilities through a lifetime, the position of a servant was not menial or degrading, but might be higher than that of the farmer, merchant, or artisan. Whether the position was a high or a low one depended, not so much on the work done, as the person for whom it was done, and the servant of a daimiō or high rank samurai was worthy of more honor, and might be of far better birth, than the independent <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>merchant or artisan. As the former feudal system is yet within the memory of many of the present generation, and its feelings still alive in Japan, much of the old sentiment remains, even with the merely hired domestics in a household of the present day. The servant, by his own master, is addressed by name, with no title of respect, is treated as an inferior, and spoken to in the language used toward inferiors; but to all others he is a person to be treated with respect,—to be bowed to profoundly, addressed by the title San, and spoken to in the politest of language. You make a call upon a Japanese household, and the servant who admits you will expect to exchange the formal salutations with you. When you are ushered into the reception-room, should the lady of the house be absent, the head servants will not only serve you with tea and refreshments and offer you hospitalities in their mistress's name, but may, if no one else be there, sit with you in the parlor, entertaining you with conversation until the return of the hostess. The servants of the household are by no means ignored socially, as they are with us, but are always recognized and saluted <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>by visitors as they pass into and out of the room, and are free to join in the conversation of their betters, should they see any place where it is possible that they may shed light on the subject discussed. But though given this liberty of speech, treated with much consideration, and having sometimes much responsibility, servants do not forget their places in the household, and do not seem to be bold or out of place. Indeed, the manners of some of them would seem, to any one but a Japanese, to denote a lack of proper self-respect,—an excess of humility, or an affectation of it.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000559\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000559\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In explaining to my scholars, who were reading &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; in English, a passage where a footman is spoken of as having nearly disgraced himself by laughing at some quaint saying of the young lord, my little peeresses were amazed beyond measure to learn that in Europe and America a servant is expected never to show any interest in, or knowledge of, the conversation of his betters, never to speak unless addressed, and never to smile under any circumstances.

As has been explained in a previous chapter, the mistress of the house—be she princess or peasant—is herself the head servant, and only gives up to her helpers the part of the labor which she has not the time or strength to perform. Certain menial duties toward her husband and children, every Japanese wife and mother must do herself, and would scorn to delegate to any other woman except in case of absolute necessity. Thus there is not that gap between mistress and maid that exists in our days among the women of this country. The servants work with their mistress, helping her in every possible way, and are treated as responsible members of the household, if not of the family itself.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000562\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000562\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000563\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000563\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>At evening, when the wooden shutters are slid into their places around the porch and the lamps are lighted, the family gather together in the sitting-room around the <i>hibachi</i> to talk, free from interruption, for no visitor comes at such an hour to disturb the family circle.

In a somewhat similar way, places in the homes of those of distinction<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> or skill in any art or profession are held in great demand among the Japanese; and a prominent poet, scholar, physician, or professional man of any kind is often asked by anxious parents to take their sons under his own roof, so that they may be under his influence, and receive the benefits of stay in such an honorable house. The parents who thus send their children may not be of low rank at all, but are usually not sufficiently well-to-do to spend much money in the education of their children. The position that such boys occupy in the household is a curious one. They are called <i>Sho-séi</i>, meaning students, and students they usually are, spending all their leisure moments and their evenings in study. They are never treated as inferiors, except in age and experience; they may or may not eat with the family, and are always addressed with respect.

We have seen that there is no distinct servile class in Japan, and that a person's social status is not altered by the fact that he serves in a menial capacity, provided that service be of one above him in rank and not below him. This is largely the result of the grading of society upon other lines than those on which our social distinctions are founded, and partly the result of the fact that women, of whatever class, are servants so far as persons of the opposite sex in their own class are concerned. The women of Japan to-day form the great servile class, and, as they are also the wives and mothers of those whom they serve, they are treated, of course, with a certain consideration and respect never given to a mere servant; and through them, all domestic service is elevated.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000804\\\">[*]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000579\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000579\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>There are two employments which I have mentioned among those of domestic servants because they would be so classed by us, but which in Japan rank among the trades. The <i>jinrikisha</i> man and the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> groom belong, as a rule, to a certain class at the bottom of the social ladder, and no samurai would think of entering either of these occupations, except under stress of severest poverty. The <i>bettōs</i>, or grooms, are a hereditary class and a regular guild, and have a reputation, among both Japanese and foreigners, as a betting, gambling, cheating, good-for-nothing lot. An honest <i>bettō</i> is a rare phenomenon. The <i>jinrikisha</i> men are, many of them, sons of peasants, who come to the cities for the sake of earning more money, or leading a livelier life than can be found in the little thatched cottage among the rice-fields. Few of them are married, or have homes of their own. Many of them drink and gamble, and sow their wild oats in all possible ways; but they are a well-meaning, fairly honest, happy-go-lucky set, who lead hard lives of exhausting labor, and endure long hours of exposure to heat and cold, rain, snow, and blinding sunshine, not only with little complaint or grumbling, but with absolute cheerfulness and hilarity. A strong, fast <i>jinrikisha</i> man takes great pride in his strength and speed. It is a point of honor with him to pull his<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> passenger up the steepest and most slippery of hills, and never to heed him if he expresses a desire to walk in order to save his man. I have had my <i>kurumaya</i> stoutly refuse, again and again, my offers to walk up a steep hill, even when the snow was so soft and slippery under his bare feet that he fell three times in making the ascent. &quot;<i>Dai jobu</i>&quot; (safe) would be his smiling response to all my protestations; and, once in a <i>jinrikisha</i>, the passenger is entirely at the mercy of his man in all matters of getting into and out of the vehicle. But though the <i>jinrikisha</i> man is, for the time being, the autocrat and controlling power over his passenger, and though he will not obey the behests of his employer, except so far as they seem reasonable and in accordance with the best interests of all concerned, he constitutes himself the protector and assistant, the adviser and counselor, of him whom he serves, and gives his best thought and intelligence, as well as his speed and strength, to the service in which he is engaged. If he thinks it safe, he will tear like an unbroken colt through the business portions of the city, knocking bundles out of the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> hands of foot passengers, or even hitting the wayfarers themselves in a fierce dash through their midst, laughing gayly at their protests, and at threats of wrath to come from his helpless passenger; but should hint of insult or injury against <i>kuruma</i>, passenger, or passenger's dog fall upon his ears, he will drop the <i>jinrikisha</i> shafts, and administer condign punishment to the offender, unchecked by thoughts of the ever-present police, or by any terrors that his employer may hold over his head. In no other country in the world, perhaps, can a lady place more entire confidence in the honor and loyalty of her servant than she can in Japan in her <i>kurumaya</i>, whether he be her private servant, or one from a respectable stand. He may not do what she bids him, but that is quite a secondary matter. He will study her interests; will remember her likes and dislikes; will take a mental inventory of the various accessories or bundles that she carries with her, and will never permit her to lose or forget one of them; will run his legs off in her service, and defend her and her property valiantly in case of need. Of course, as in all classes there are different grades,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> so there are <i>jinrikisha</i> men who seem to have sunk so low in their calling that they have lost all feeling of loyalty to their employer, and only care selfishly for the pittance they gain. Such men are often found in the treaty ports, eagerly seeking for the rich foreigner, from whom they can get an extra fee, and whom they regard as outside of their code of morals, and hence as their natural prey. Travelers, and even residents of Japan, have often complained of such treatment; and it is only after long stay in Japan, among the Japanese themselves, that one can tell what a <i>jinrikisha</i> man is capable of.<$link class=\\\"apxanchor pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000806\\\">[*]</$link></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000580\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000580\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>If you employ one <i>kurumaya</i> for any length of time, you come to have a real affection for him on account of his loyal, faithful, cheerful service, such as we seldom find in this country except when inspired by personal feeling.

You rejoice, not only in his strength and speed, put forth so willingly in your service; in his picturesque, dark blue costume with your monogram embroidered on the back; in his handsomely turned ankles; in his black, wavy hair; in his delicate hands and trim waist,—though these are often a source of pride to you,—but his skill in divining your wants; his use of his tongue in your service; his helping out of your faltering Japanese with explanations which, if not elegant, have the merit of being easily understood; his combats with extortionate shopkeepers in your behalf; his interest in all your doings and concerns,—remain as a pleasant memory, upon your return to a land where no man would so far forget his manhood as to give himself so completely and without reserve to the service of any master save Mammon.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000581\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000581\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>As old Japan, with its quaintness, its mediæval flavor, its feudalism, its loyalty, its sense of honor, and its transcendental contempt for money and luxury, recedes into the past, and as the memories of my life there grow dim, two figures stand out<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> more and more boldly from the fading background,—both, the figures of faithful servants. One, Yasaku, the <i>kurumaya</i>, a very Hercules, who could keep close to a pair of coach horses through miles of city streets, and who never suffered mortal <i>jinrikisha</i> man to pass him. My champion in all times of danger and alarm, but a very autocrat in all minor matters,—his cheery face, his broad shoulders with their blue draperies, his jolly, boyish voice, and his dainty, delicate hands come before me as I write, and I wonder to what fortunate person he is now giving the intelligent service that he once gave so whole-heartedly to me. The other, O Kaio, my maid, her plain little face, with its upturned eyes, growing, as the days went by, absolutely beautiful in the light of pure goodness that beamed from it. A Japanese Christian, with all the Christian virtues well developed, she became to me not only a good servant, doing her work with conscientious fidelity, but a sympathetic friend, to whom I turned for help in time of need; and whom I left, when I returned to America, with a sincere sorrow in my heart at parting with one who had grown to fill so large<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> a place in my thoughts. Her little, half-shy, half-motherly ways toward her big foreign mistress had a charm all their own. Her pride and delight over my progress in the language; her patient efforts to make me understand new words, or to understand my uncouth foreign idioms; her joy, when at last I reached the point where a story told by her lips could be comprehended and enjoyed,—gave a continual encouragement in a task too often completely disheartening.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000582\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000582\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>During the last summer of my stay in Japan, cutting loose from all foreigners and foreign associations, I traveled alone with her through the heart of the country, stopping only at Japanese hotels, and carrying with me no supplies to eke out the simple Japanese fare.

In Japan the woman's place is so entirely in the home that all the ceremonies and superstitions that gather about the conduct of every-day affairs are more to her than they are to the freer and broader-minded man. The household worship, the yearly round of festivals, each with its special food to be prepared, the observances connected with birth and marriage and death; what is to be done in time of illness, of earthquake, of fire, or of the frequent flittings that render life in Japan one succession of packings and unpackings,—all <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>these are matters of high importance to the wife and mother, and their proper observance is left largely in her hands.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000586\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000586\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Every well-ordered Japanese home of the old-fashioned kind has its little shrine, which is the centre of the religious life of the house. If the household is of the Shintō faith, this shrine is called the <i>kami-dana</i>, or god shelf, and contains the symbols of the gods, <i>gohei</i> in vases, receptacles for food and drink, and a primitive lamp,—only a saucer of oil in which a bit of pith serves for a wick. Daily offerings must be made before this shrine, and reverence paid by the clapping of hands; while on feast days special offerings and invocations are required. In Buddhist families, the <i>Butsudan</i>, or Buddha shelf, takes the place of the <i>kami-dana</i>, and the worship is slightly more complicated. Greater variety of food is offered, and the simple clapping of the hands and bowing of the head that is the form of prayer in the Shintō religion is replaced by the burning of incense and by actual verbal invocation of Buddha. These religious ceremonies <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>must be attended to by the mother or wife. She it is who sets the rice and wine before the ancestral tablets, who lights the little lamp each night, and who sees that at each feast day and anniversary season the proper food is prepared and set out for the household gods.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000587\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000587\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Upon the wife, and her attention to minute and apparently trifling details, depends much of the well-being of the family. Each child, as it grows toward maturity, gathers from various sources a collection of amulets, which, while worn always when the child is in full dress, are frequently too precious for ordinary play times and the risks and perils of every-day life. These must be kept carefully by the mother as a safeguard against the many evils that beset child-life. I have spoken of the amulets given at the times of the <i>miya mairi</i>,—both the first, when the name is given to the baby, and the subsequent visits made to the temple by the children as they pass certain stated points in their progress toward maturity. These amulets are simply written papers or slips of<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> wood with the seal of the temple from which they are issued stamped upon them. Visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the child's collection. One kind of charm is good to keep the eyes strong; another will help its possessor to that much-prized accomplishment, a good handwriting; another acts as an assurance against accident and saves the child from harm in case of a fall. All these are put together by the careful mother and preserved as jealously as Queen Althea kept the charred stick that governed the destiny of her son. As the children arrive at years of discretion, these treasures pass out of the mother's faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners, and they are usually kept stored away in some little-used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life. Perhaps of all the curious things that go to make up these intimate personal belongings of a Japanese man or woman, there is none more curious than the small white parcel containing a portion of the umbilical cord,—saved at birth<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> and preserved until death that it may be buried with its possessor and furnish him the means of a new birth. These little paper packages, each marked with the name of the child to whom it belongs, are kept by the mother.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000588\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000588\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Upon the mother of the family rests very largely the determining of lucky and unlucky days for the beginning or transaction of different kinds of business. A fortune-teller is consulted for important things, such as removals or marriages, but in every-day life one cannot be running to a fortune-teller about everything; and yet there is bad luck lurking in the background that may baffle all our plans if we do not observe the proper times and seasons for our undertakings. Just as the Japanese calendar divides time into cycles of twelve years, each year named for a different animal, so also the days and hours are divided into twelves and bear the names of the same twelve animals,—the Chinese signs of the zodiac. These animals are as follows: the rat, the bull, the tiger, the hare, the dragon, the snake, the horse, the goat, the monkey, the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> cock, the dog, and the boar. Each animal brings its own kind of good or bad luck into the hour, day, or year over which it presides, and only a skillful balancer of pros and cons can read aright the combinations, and understand what the luck of any particular hour in any particular day of any particular year will be. For instance, the rat, which is the companion of Daikoku, the money god, is a lucky animal so far as money is concerned. A person born in the year of the rat will never need money, and will be economical, possibly miserly; and in one born on the day of the rat in the year of the rat these chances and qualities will be doubled. But the luck of the rat may be very seriously interfered with by the bad luck of the monkey or of the proverbially unlucky dog, when their days and hours occur in the rat year. On the other hand, their bad luck may be counteracted by the good luck of the tiger or hare, for as a rule three animals of different portent are presiding over human prospects every hour. This makes prophecy a ticklish business, requiring a wise head, but it also leaves<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> much room for the subsequent explanation of failures by the superior and unusual influence of one or another of the animals, as the case may require. Momentous questions of this kind have frequently to be settled by the Japanese wife and mother, and she gains dignity and value in her home and neighborhood according to her skill in interpreting the portents of the day and hour.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000589\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000589\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>For the greater events of family life the home prophecies are felt to be too uncertain, and the services of the fortune-teller must be called in. No well-managed family would think of building a new house without finding in what direction to face the front door. In an American city this necessity would cause considerable inconvenience, as the position of the front door is usually determined by the relation of the building-lot to the street; but in a Japanese city, where, in all but the business quarters, every house is concealed by a high board fence, and where the gate that admits one within the fence is the only sign by which any one in the street can judge of the worldly condition of the dwellers<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> within, the houses are faced about any and every way, and the position of each is determined by the good luck that it will bring its owner. After this matter has been settled and the house is fairly begun, there are occasional crises in its construction upon which much depends. Of these the most important is the day when the roof is raised. The roof timbers, which are unsquared logs, often rather crooked, after being carefully fitted and framed in some convenient vacant lot, are brought on carts to the site of the new building, and when all is ready, the head carpenter sends word to the house-owner that he is about to set the roof in place. The house-owner then decides whether the day set by the builder is a lucky one for himself and his family. If it is not, a delay in the building is always preferable to any danger of incurring the displeasure of the luck gods. This crisis safely passed, and the last of the roof beams secured in its place, the men take a holiday, and are feasted on <i>saké</i> and spaghetti by the house-owner. A present of money to each workman is also in order, and will<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> conduce to the rapid and faithful execution of the job in hand. When, at last, the house is finished, and carpenters and plasterers are ready to leave it, the local firemen, who have assisted all along in the building as unskilled laborers, often ascend to the roof, and from the ridge-pole cast down cakes, for which the children of the neighborhood scramble joyfully.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000590\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000590\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>When the builders have left, and the house is ready for occupation, even to the soft, thick mats on the floor and the white paper windows, the family will move in on the first day thereafter that is both lucky and pleasant. So far as possible, everything in the old house will be packed and ready the day before, and very early in the morning the relatives and friends of the mover will begin to rally around him. All come who can, and those who cannot come send servants or provisions. Every tradesman or <i>kurumaya</i> who has had or who hopes to have the patronage of the moving household sends a representative to help along the work, so that there is always a sufficient force to carry the household<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> belongings into the new home and settle them in place before the day is over. All these visiting helpers must be fed and provided with tea and cakes at proper intervals, and the presents of cooked food that pour in at such times are highly acceptable and of great practical usefulness. When the long day is ended and the visitors return one by one to their homes, it is the mistress of the house who must see that every servant and representative of a business firm receives, neatly done up in white paper, a present of money properly proportioned to his services, and the style and circumstances of the family he has been aiding. And when all are gone, the shutters closed, and the family left alone in their new home, the little wife must make a list of all who have helped in any way during the day, and to all, within a short time, make some acknowledgment of their kindness by either a call or a present. It is upon the wife, too, that the duty falls of sending to each of the near neighbors <i>soba</i>, a kind of macaroni, as an announcement of the family's arrival. The number of neighbors to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> whom this gift is sent is determined differently according to circumstances. If the house is one of several in a compound, <i>soba</i> will be sent to all within the gate; but if the compound is very large, so that the sending to all would be too great an expense, the five nearest houses will be selected to receive the gift, or all who draw water from the same well. A very late fashion in Tōkyō, but one that is gaining ground because of its convenience, is to send, not the macaroni itself, but an order on the nearest restaurant at which that delicacy is sold.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000591\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000591\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>As I have already said, much of a woman's time and thought must be given to the proper distribution of presents among friends and dependents. The subject of what to give, when to give, to whom to give, and how to do up the gift acceptably, is one the thorough understanding of which requires the study of years. No foreigner can hope to do more than dabble in the shallows of it. Presents seem to be used more for the purpose of keeping those persons whose services you may need, or whose enmity you dread, under a sense of obligation,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> than they are as expressions of sentiment. Every housekeeper, for instance, must need the occasional services of a carpenter or a gardener, and in a large city like Tōkyō the chances are that she will some day need, and need very badly, the services of a fireman. A wise woman—one who is not penny wise and pound foolish—will by timely presents keep herself constantly in the minds of such persons, so that when she sends for them, they may feel under sufficient obligation to her to come at once. So will her house be quickly put in repair after earthquake or other accident; her garden show for only the briefest interval the ravages of the typhoon which has gullied out her lawn and leveled her choicest trees; and when some night &quot;the flower of Yedo&quot; blooms suddenly by her side, she will have the speedy assistance of the firemen, who will seal her storehouse securely with clay, wet her roof and walls thoroughly with water, and light at her gates the great alarm lanterns to tell her friends that her house is in danger and summon them to her assistance. No friend can disregard such a<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> signal, but all will rally round her once more to help in this less orderly and cheerful moving,—will pack and cord and carry out her goods, and if at last the fire consumes her dwelling, will gather her household and belongings into their hospitable homes. But the foolish woman, who neglects or forgets her dependents when she does not need them, finds some day that her roof is leaking, but all the carpenters are too busy to mend it, her garden is destroyed because the gardener had an important engagement elsewhere just when she needed him, and her property is burned up or ruined by water and smoke because the firemen attended to her house last when the fire swept over her compound.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000592\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000592\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>When death enters a house in Japan, there are no undertakers to relieve the family of the painful duty of caring for the dead body and placing it in the coffin.

As soon as the breath finally leaves the body, it is wrapped in a quilt, laid with its head to the north, and an inverted screen placed around it.

The proper offerings are flowers, cake, vegetables, candles, incense, or small gifts of money for the purchase of incense.

In the washing of the body none but members of the family must assist, and respect for the dead absolutely requires<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> that all the relatives of the deceased who are below him in rank must have a hand in these final ablutions. In Japan, the mourning for the dead is the duty of inferiors, never of superiors. There is no official, ceremonial mourning of parents for their children, nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rites, or attend the funeral. Upon the younger brothers and sisters falls the duty of attending to all the last sad ministrations. If the wife dies, her husband does not mourn for her, though her children do; but if the husband dies, the wife must mourn the rest of her life, cutting off her hair and placing it in the coffin as a sign of her perpetual faithfulness.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000595\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000595\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>When the body has been washed, it is dressed in white, in silk <i>habutai</i> whenever the family can afford it.

The single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in, to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death. Last of all, the vacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea.

This provision would seem in most countries to be mere eccentricity, but when one has seen or heard of the gruesome ceremony that follows immediately after death, and the burden of which falls, not on the old and hardened, but on the young and tender, suffering, in many cases, under the weight of a first and crushing affliction, one can see that only through such means as this can the burden ever be lifted from the shoulders of those who mourn.

Just before the procession starts, a religious ceremony is held at the house, which is attended by the friends of the deceased, and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery. On the day of the burial, great bunches of natural flowers are sent to the dead, each bunch so large as to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> require the services of one man to carry it. Sometimes with the gift a man is sent to take part in the procession, but if the giver feels too poor to hire a man, this burden, too, falls upon the bereaved household, for etiquette requires that all flowers sent be borne to the grave by uniformed coolies, who march in the funeral train. Another favorite present at this time, among Buddhists, is a cage of living birds, to be borne to the grave and released thereon.

For a time after death has come into the family the relatives of the dead are regarded<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> as ceremonially unclean. The period of defilement varies with the nearness of relationship. In the old days, no one thus defiled was allowed to go about his regular business or to mingle with other men; but busy modern Japan does not find it convenient to pause long in its work, so that government officials and school-children are now sent written papers excusing them for coming back to their tasks even while ceremonially unclean. Thus the old custom is passing away. In the first year after death, certain days are observed with special honors before the memorial tablet, and later, certain anniversaries of the death must be kept, until, at last, at the end of fifty or one hundred years, the personality of the spirit seems to become merged with that of the other ancestral spirits, and no offerings are made to it except at the general feasts of the dead.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000602\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000602\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>With the coming in of the last month of the year begin the preparations for the great New Year's festival, and the housekeeper finds herself occupied through every moment of the brief days.

Within the first seven days every man in Japan is expected to call on all his friends and acquaintances, but the women, probably out of consideration for the many duties that the festival season puts upon them, are given until March to finish up their New Year's calls.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000612\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000612\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The streets of the cities, and even of the small villages, are full of life and interest for a week or two. <i>Kurumayas</i> in their new winter liveries trundle around fathers and mothers and happy children.

For the boys there are kites of many shapes and colors, or tops that they spin under every one's feet, well knowing that no one in Japan is too busy to turn aside for a child's pleasure.

To find the O Bon ceremonies in their most perfect form, it is necessary now to go into the more remote country villages, for though, even in Tōkyō, this feast is still one of the most important in the whole year, it seems to be more distinctly itself in a small village, where all the old forms are still kept up.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000614\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000614\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In Tōkyō, the three days' festival is kept by the new calendar, and occurs on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth of July. At O Bon, as at New Year's time, it is customary to square off all<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> obligations by a general giving of presents. This, while not quite as important a matter as at the beginning of the year, is still a severe tax upon the time, purse, and memory of the wife and mother in any large family. At this time, too, as at New Year's, <i>mochi</i> or some other festival dish must be provided, but at this point the resemblance between the two occasions ceases. In accordance with its character as a feast of departed spirits, the observance of O Bon is distinctively religious. On the twelfth, the family go to the graveyard and clean and put in order the graves and tombstones, so that the returning spirits may find all properly cared for. Fresh water and flowers are placed before each stone, and sometimes rice and fresh vegetables. At home, the ancestral tablets in the <i>Butsudan</i> form the centre of the ceremonies. Before the shrine are placed, on the thirteenth, offerings of food of any kind that can be made without fish or meat. Great balls of <i>mochi</i>, <i>saké</i>, flowers, and choice new varieties of vegetables are appropriate offerings. All are tastefully arranged, the lamps are carefully lighted<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> every night, and special services are held before the shrine. For the three days of the feast, the souls of the dead are believed to be visiting their old haunts, and to need light and food and all the conveniences that their descendants can spare them. Each house is decorated with lanterns, that the spirits may be able to find their way. It is from this custom that the feast is often called by foreigners the Feast of Lanterns.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000615\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000615\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>As I have already said, in Tōkyō and other modernized places, this feast is not seen at its best. Only the soft glow of the lanterns swinging from every house, and the decorations in the graveyards and at the household shrines, indicate to the traveler that anything unusual is going on. But in the country regions it is quite another matter, and the welcoming, entertainment, and proper dismissal of the visiting spirits form the entire business of the community for three days. Usually the middle of August is the time for the country celebration. On the twelfth, bands of children carrying red lanterns march singing through the village on their way to the graveyard,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> where the annual cleaning is taking place. That night bonfires in the cemetery and before the houses light the pathway of the wanderers. Then for three nights all the young people of the village gather in the temple court in grotesque disguises and with towels over their faces, and dance all night long in the moonlight, to primitive music produced by a drum and the monotonous chant of the dancers themselves. These three dance-nights are the great occasion of the year to the young peasants, for this is the only time when persons of both sexes meet together in a social way, and it is long looked forward to and enjoyed intensely. Of late years, the government, fearing the abuses that grow out of this exceptional social event, has endeavored to suppress the dancing, but it continues in full vigor throughout most of rural Japan, though conducted with more decorum than formerly on account of the standing dread of police interference. The object of the dance is to amuse the spirits of the ancestors, who must be imagined as hovering in the background, viewing with approval the antics of their descendants.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000616\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000616\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000617\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000617\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Other amusements are going on in the village on the O Bon evenings.

It comes on the fifth day of the fifth month (now May fifth), and for long before its arrival the shops are gay with all manner of tempting toys, while in every yard rises a great bamboo pole, from which, when the time comes, will float an enormous carp, its body inflated by the strong spring wind, its great mouth wide open, and its eyes glaring hideously, as it fights its way against the air currents. Sometimes there will be half a dozen such poles in one yard,—signs either that the household is blessed with many boys, or that the way to its heart is through gifts of toys to its son and heir. When the great day at last arrives, the feast within the home is conducted in much the same way as the Feast of Dolls. There are the same red-covered shelves, the same offerings of food and drink; but instead of the placid<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> images of the Emperor and Empress and the five court musicians, the household furnishings and toilet articles, there are effigies of the heroes of history and folklore: Jingo, the warrior Empress; Takenouchi, her white-haired prime minister, holding in his arms her son, the infant war-god; Benkei, the giant retainer of Yoshitsune; Yoshitsune himself, the marvelous fencer and general; Kintaro, the fat, hairy, red boy, who was born and grew up in the mountains, and even in his babyhood fought with bears; Shoki Sama, the strong man who could conquer <i>oni</i>;—these are some of the characters to be found on the shelves at the boys' feast. Behind each figure stands a flag with the crest of the hero that it represents, and before them are set all manner of weapons in miniature. The food offered is <i>mochi</i> wrapped in oak leaves, because the oak is among trees what the carp is among fishes, the emblem of strength and endurance. The flower of this day is the iris or flag, because of its sword-shaped leaves,—hence the name, <i>Shobu Matsuri</i>, feast of iris or flag.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000620\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000620\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000621\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000621\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Another feast, which, while not founded for the boys, seems to have been adopted by them as a great occasion, is what is known as Buddha's birthday, celebrated on April eighth.

Upon this platform, in a great tub filled with licorice tea, is set a small image of the infant Buddha. Hither flock the small boys with bamboo dippers, and spend the day ladling up the tea and pouring it over the image, and then ladling it out into small bamboo buckets. This licorice tea, through contact with the image, acquires miraculous healing properties, and the devout, after making offerings of money twisted up in white paper, carry away the little buckets. The tea is good for the eyes and the throat, and if some of it be used in mixing ink, and then, with the ink thus mixed, a charm be written and placed about the house, it will keep away all vermin.

Here are lanterns being made with the <i>mon</i> of the gods on one side and the rising sun of the Japanese flag on the other. There a dancing platform is being erected, and at every stage of its development it is swarming with active youngsters, who shin up its poles, turn somersaults on the platform, and sit in rows on its edge, with bare legs swinging high over the heads of the passers-by; and when it is done, and the drums installed, they take turns all day and far into the night in keeping them going. Then, too, there are the <i>dashi</i>, or floats, on one of which each street in the parish spends its money and its ingenuity. How the boys haunt the shops in which they are being made! How they watch the wondrous changes of paper<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> into flowers, and of bamboo and cotton cloth into sea waves, or castle walls, or monsters of earth or sea or air! How they chatter and wriggle and push and squirm for front places, when at last the great cars are built up in the open street, the marvelous edifices erected upon them, and at the top of all the heroic figures of well-known mythological or historical characters rise majestic in flowing robes! Then, when the black bullocks, resplendent in collars and halters of red rope, are yoked to the triumphal car, and the structure moves slowly down the shouting street, how the boys crawl into every joint and cranny of the <i>dashi</i>, how they hang from every beam, how they yell from before and behind in sheer abandon of joy! And at last, when the procession forms, and with fantastically garbed men marching in front and wild-eyed singers yelling just behind them, with dancing-girls on moving platforms and jugglers and tumblers on the <i>dashi</i> themselves, the twenty or more festal cars move, with frequent stops, down to the temple, to escort the sacred symbols on their annual pilgrimage<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> through the parish, who so noisy or so ubiquitous as these same bullet-headed, blue-gowned boys? They bob up at every turn, ooze out at every pore of the procession, and enjoy, as only boys can enjoy, the noise and confusion, the barbaric splendor, the dancing and tumbling, the mumming and drumming, the excruciating howls of the singers, the jingling of the marshals' iron-ringed staves, the clapping of the great wooden clappers that time the movement and the stops of the pageant.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000623\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000623\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Better than all, perhaps, is the evening, when the streets, lighted by many lanterns, are filled with throngs of holiday-makers,—now stopping to stare in at some shop where the devout worshiper has established a beautiful shrine, has set out <i>mochi</i> and other offerings before some image, or has arranged a landscape garden in a box, or constructed a <i>matsuri</i> procession just entering the court of a miniature temple; now haggling with the ever-present booth-keepers for lanterns or cakes or hairpins to take back to the friends left at home. Suddenly there is a joyous, rhythmic<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> shout of many excited boyish voices, there is a gleaming of square red lanterns, a whirl and a rush through the crowd. Now is the time to get out of the way, for the boys move quickly and are too excited to turn aside for anything. On they come at a sharp trot, each little round head bound about with a fillet of blue and white toweling, each lithe, active body more or less covered by a blue and white gown, all shouting in unison and bearing on their shoulders a miniature <i>dashi</i>, made most often of a <i>saké</i> tub mounted on a frame, and decorated with lanterns and white paper. They charge through the crowd, which makes way quickly at their approach, until the pace, the weight of their burden, and the frantic shouting exhaust their breath. Then they plunge down a side street, rest for a few moments, gather themselves together, and charge once more into the crowd.

There seems to be an uneasy feeling in the minds of even the more conservative men that some change in the status of woman is inevitable, if the nation wishes to keep the pace it has set for itself. The Japanese women of the past and of the present are exactly suited to the position accorded them in society, and any attempt to alter them without changing their status only results in making square pegs for round holes. If the pegs hereafter are to be cut square, the holes must be enlarged and squared to fit them. The Japanese woman stands in no need of alteration unless her place in life is somehow enlarged, nor, on the other hand, can she fill a larger place without additional<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> training. The men of New Japan, to whom the opinions and customs of the Western world are becoming daily more familiar, while they shrink aghast, in many cases, at the thought that their women may ever become like the forward, self-assertive, half-masculine women of the West, show a growing tendency to dissatisfaction with the smallness and narrowness of the lives of their wives and daughters,—a growing belief that better educated women would make better homes, and that the ideal home of Europe and America is the product of a more advanced civilization than that of Japan. Reluctantly in many cases, but still almost universally, it is admitted that in the interest of the homes and for the sake of future generations, something must be done to carry the women forward into a position more in harmony with what the nation is reaching for in other directions. This desire shows itself in individual efforts to improve by more advanced education daughters of exceptional promise, and in general efforts for the improvement of the condition of women. Well-to-do<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> fathers are willing to spend more money on the education of their daughters, to send them abroad, if possible, to complete their studies, or to postpone the time of marriage so that plans for higher education may be carried through. Where, ten years ago, the number of women who had been abroad for study might be counted on the fingers of one hand, there are now three or four times that number in Tōkyō alone. Another sign of the times is the fact that husbands going abroad on business or for pleasure are more inclined to take their wives with them, even if it be only for a few months. There are now to be found, in all the larger cities, women who have spent a longer or shorter time in some foreign country, whose minds have been opened and whose horizons have been enlarged by contact with new ideas. All this cannot fail to have its effect, sooner or later, upon the country at large.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000628\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000628\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The efforts for the improvement of women in general may be grouped into four classes: by legislation, by education, through the press, and by means of societies for mutual improvement.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000629\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000629\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000630\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000630\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Of the recent legislation concerning marriage and divorce and its effect on the family, I have spoken in a preceding chapter. The latest statistics show that, while before the new laws were enacted divorces were one to every three marriages, they have now been reduced to one in five. It must be said, however, that the law is still somewhat in advance of public opinion. While the chance of permanence in marriage is better now than it was before the new code came into force, custom is still stronger than the law, and marriage is too often a temporary arrangement. In many cases the wife knows little or nothing of her new rights, and even when she does know, she has seldom the self-assertion to make a stand for them, but meekly submits to the dictates of those whom she is bound by custom, if not by law, to respect and obey without question. But the fact that the laws have actually been improved means, in a country like Japan, in which the government is the moulder of public opinion, that the custom will some day conform to the law.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000631\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000631\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the matter of property owning,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> women, under the new code, are fairly independent. As I have already stated, every woman in Japan is expected to become a wife, and as a matter of fact, the number of unmarried women is so small that it is hardly necessary to mention them. Wives, under Japanese law, are divided into two classes: the wife who enters her husband's family, and the wife whose husband becomes a member of her family. In the latter case the wife is the head of the family, is responsible for the debts of the family, and has the right to use and profit by the husband's property. In the former case (and as I have already stated, the great majority of wives enter their husband's families), the husband is responsible, and has, consequently, the right to use and profit by his wife's property. In all cases, unless the husband is physically or mentally unfit, he has the management of his wife's wealth. In case of the husband's disability the woman takes care of her own. A wife may, by application to a court, cause the husband to furnish security for the property that she has intrusted to him; and she may, with her husband's<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> consent, engage in independent business. The property that she thus acquires is her own and not the husband's. Any property in the family, the ownership of which is not perfectly established, belongs to the head of the family, whether male or female. We thus see that the law of Japan fully recognizes the right of married women to hold property, although only in exceptional cases are they allowed the management of their own holdings. The law also regards the wife, in household matters, as her husband's agent.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000632\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000632\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In actual practice, it is not uncommon for the wife to manage the entire income of the family, receiving it from her husband and acting as his treasurer. The wife's own earnings are seldom given to the husband, and her position is one of entire independence in the disposal of whatever she adds to the family revenue. But should the wife bring into the family at marriage property which passes into the husband's management, the chances are that, unless a divorce should occur, she will never lay any claim to the principal, or think of it<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> again as her own. While her husband cannot actually dispose of it without her consent, she is pretty certain to give her consent should he ask it, and he may do very nearly anything that he chooses with it. We thus see that the tendency is to give the management of the income, as a part of the management of the household, to the woman, and leave the disposal of the principal, as a part of the outside business, to the care of the man. This system of domestic finance seems not unlike the common practice in thrifty and well-managed homes in America, and shows that a spirit of mutual confidence between husband and wife belongs to Japan as to Western nations. As the result of my own observation in a number of homes, I should say that the judgment of the wife in money matters is quite as much trusted in Japan as in America, and that, in this one respect at least, her place in the home is as responsible a one as that of the Western housekeeper. One instance may be cited of a woman whose business ability is so well known as to have a national reputation. <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>By birth a member of a family which is remarkable for its success in all financial undertakings, she has inherited a large share of the family characteristic, and is credited with the personal management of a large bank, as well as other successful business undertakings. Her husband's name and not her own appears on the prospectuses and in the newspapers, but unless report is very far astray, she is the business man of the family, and her sound sense and good judgment have built up the fortune which is their common possession.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000633\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000633\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the educational system of Japan, schools for girls are provided by the government, but no provision for studies more advanced than those of the middle schools for boys is included in the scheme, with the single exception of the Higher Normal School in Tōkyō, in which a limited number of young women are trained to take positions as teachers in the ordinary normal schools for girls. To quote from the Annual Report of the Minister of Education for the year 1898, the latest to which I have access,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> &quot;Higher female schools are institutions designed to give instruction in such higher subjects of general education as are necessary for females.&quot; This shows with considerable completeness the idea that dominates all government and much private effort for the education of women in Japan. The schools are to teach simply such subjects as are necessary for females; anything more would be superfluous, possibly dangerous. The thought of women as individuals, with minds and souls to be trained and developed to their highest possibilities, is still somewhat foreign to the mind of the average Japanese man. In its stead is the idea that females must be instructed in such subjects as are necessary for a proper understanding of their duties as wives and mothers. But if Japan to-day is where England and America were in the first half of the nineteenth century, the country is certainly moving forward, as the statistics in regard to education for the three successive years 1896, 1897, and 1898 show.

The boys' middle schools, which are equivalent in grade to the girls' high schools, have fourteen boys taking their courses to every two girls in the high schools. In the apprentice and technical schools, there are fifteen men to every two women.

Beyond this point women have no opportunities offered to them.

The year 1901 sees two hopeful movements well begun. One of these is the opening of an institution bearing the title of &quot;Female University,&quot; endowed and supported by Japanese, through the strenuous efforts of Mr. Jinzo Naruse, a prominent Christian who has spent some time in America. At its opening, five hundred girls were glad to enter, but of these very few are ready for college work. Mr. Naruse, however, believes that in time he will be able to enlarge his college department and diminish the preparatory, which is now almost the whole of the school. He has the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> support and encouragement of many wealthy and influential Japanese, among them Count Okuma, the well-known progressive statesman. On the day of the opening of the school, Count Okuma, in a speech from the platform, said that the nation would be twice as strong if its women were well educated. This he called &quot;setting up a double standard.&quot; He pointed out that Turkey, Egypt, Persia, and China were countries which had tried to get along with a &quot;single standard,&quot; and which had fallen conspicuously behind. He called attention to the fact that Japan's primitive religion had for its central figure the Goddess of Light, but that, unfortunately for the well-being of the state, woman had been gradually dethroned and thrust down into a low place. After speaking of the debt that Japan owed to China for the civilization and the ethical system that had stood her so long in good stead, the veteran statesman went on to say that society in Japan was disfigured by abuses which were beyond any simple remedy. The only effective medicine was to be found in a radical reform of the<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> ideals of family life, and this could only be effected by an improvement in the status of woman,—an improvement which such institutions as the one that day opened would greatly aid in bringing about.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000636\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000636\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>These words from one of the most honored leaders of Japanese thought voice the feeling that is prevalent throughout Japan in this thirty-fourth year of Méiji.

After many years of work as a teacher in the Peeresses' School, a place of great honor from the Japanese standpoint, she has resigned her position to carry out a long-cherished plan. With the pecuniary aid of friends in America, she has founded a school for the preparation of young women who have finished the courses heretofore open to them, and who wish to become teachers of English in the Government schools. The examinations for such positions have always been open to women, but, because of the difficulty in securing proper preparation, there are few who pass them. Since its opening in September, 1900, the school has been crowded with promising pupils, and the small accommodations with which it began, although already once enlarged, are stretched to the uttermost. The girls come from the government high schools and from the mission schools, and the course offered to them of three years of study in English literature, composition, translation, and methods of teaching has proved a strong attraction. In recognition, perhaps, of this effort on behalf of<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> her countrywomen, certainly, of her position at the head of her profession, this same woman has this year been appointed on the examining committee for the government English examinations, an honor never before given to one of her sex,—in itself a sign of the change in thought that the last few years have wrought.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000638\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000638\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>There can be no doubt that the education of women is moving forward, pushed by the leading men of the country and aided by the earnest work of the women themselves.

They devote themselves largely to lectures on morals and manners, and instruction as to how best to perform the duties of the home.

A brief survey of the sentiments and ideas thus boldly set forth will show how far is the attitude of the Japanese from that of the American public on the woman question. We find in Mr. Fukuzawa's book the lofty ideal that belongs to the most advanced modern thought, but its promulgation as a practical working ideal in Japan was of the nature of a thunderclap.

If he refuses, she should not insist on his hearing her, but wait until he is willing to listen, and though she may try two or three times, she should never anger or irritate him.

Fukuzawa also throws new light on the duty of husbands and fathers to their wives and children in another respect. He says that no man should let the sole responsibility for the happiness of the home fall upon his wife; that a man is responsible for the peace of the home as well as the woman. This view of the matter is entirely new in Japan, as the responsibility for an unhappy home is laid as a matter of course upon the wife. The duty of a wife to her parents-in-law is also treated after the same revolutionary manner. Is it to be wondered at that many men fear the influence of such a book upon their gentle, submissive wives? In this connection it<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> is interesting, however, to note that at a recent Shintō wedding, after the religious ceremony, which in itself marks a great step forward in the Japanese ideal of marriage, the priest who united the couple presented to the bride a copy each of the Kaibara and Fukuzawa books, perhaps with a view to letting her take her choice between the old style and the new, perhaps that she might instruct her husband out of the Fukuzawa book while she put in practice herself the time-honored precepts of Kaibara.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000643\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000643\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\">\\n\\n</div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000644\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000644\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>One feature of the times in Tōkyō, that is perhaps worthy of passing notice, is the tendency of women to form themselves into societies and clubs for the attainment of some common object. Of these women's clubs, the greater proportion are perhaps educational, the members meeting once a month or once a fortnight to listen to a lecture upon some subject that helps to keep them up with the times. There is also a patriotic society, that concerns itself with raising money for sending supplies to soldiers in the field, or for widows and orphans of<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> soldiers, or to help along some other patriotic enterprise. There are societies, too, for general benevolence, or to help in carrying on the work of some one institution. A glance at the membership lists of these associations shows that the motive power is, in almost all cases, the same group of earnest, educated women, who are, in this way and in countless others, doing their utmost to broaden the horizons of their countrywomen, and lead them out into a larger life. This is probably true in the other cities in which a movement of women into clubs and societies is noticeable.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000645\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000645\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>It is when the active women of the new way of thinking, whose lives and thoughts are devoted to work and endeavor rather than to the passive submission and self-abnegation of the old days, find themselves suddenly placed among the surroundings of thirty years ago, that the change of conditions becomes most evident.

The house was clean and spacious, the mats soft and white, the bows of the lowest, the voices and speech the politest that Japan could furnish, but the healthy, restless children found the conventional restraints irksome, and the old-fashioned diet of rice and pickles, with hardly a variation from morning till night and from week to week, was quite different from the bountiful table to which they had been accustomed. The younger woman could not criticise her mother-in-law's arrangements, neither could she bear to see her children growing thin and pale before her eyes. She consulted her husband, who, in accordance with the antique ideas of propriety, was served his meals at a different time and in a different room from his wife and<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> family. To his food his mother had always added various delicacies which her old-time Spartan spirit would not allow her to set before her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. It would have been quite contrary to her ideas of rank and etiquette for her to make any modification of her ordinary fare for them. As the son was already supplying the funds for carrying on his mother's establishment, it occurred to him that he might increase her allowance on the plea that her summer expenses must be heavy with so large an addition to her household. But the old lady was sure that nothing more was necessary, and would not think of burdening her son with any larger expenses, and could not be induced to accept the offered increase.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000647\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000647\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Another effort was made to get along upon the meagre fare, but the youngest boy fell ill and had to be taken to a hospital, and the mother decided that something must be done if all the family did not wish to follow him.

Of course, the present was accepted with many thanks and expressions of unworthiness, and when the meal-hour arrived, each member of the family found an infinitesimal quantity of the delicacy in a small plate at his side. But as soon as the meal was over, the dear old lady, who had by strict economy managed to leave the greater part of the gift untouched, sent out to all the neighbors presents from what had been intended to feed the hungry children at home. The experiment was tried again and again, but always with the same result. No present could be kept for family use alone.

The growth of the public school system has made a demand for women as teachers that is steadily increasing. Although in the normal schools the proportion of women to men is still only one to six, and while teaching, even in the primary schools, is not yet mainly in feminine hands as it is with us, there is still a good showing of women employed as teachers. From the figures of the school report of 1898, we find over 10,000<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> women as teachers and assistants in the public and private schools. The profession of nursing, too, which ten years ago was just opening, has already drawn many women into its ranks. In the Red Cross hospitals alone there are this year nearly a thousand nurses taking the course, and a thousand graduates scattered throughout the country hold themselves ready to answer the call of the society in the time of need, in the mean time practicing their profession wherever they may chance to be. The quality of the Red Cross graduates has been tested now in two wars, and they show the soldierly virtues of their nation, as well as the more womanly qualities of tenderness and gentleness; and a self-respect that has kept them pure and free from stain in the midst of severe temptation. It is impossible for me to gather statistics of the work done by other institutions for the training of nurses, but the figures given above may, I think, be doubled with absolute safety in making an estimate of the total number of nurses trained and in training throughout the empire.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000650\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000650\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000651\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000651\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The growth of commerce and industry has greatly increased the demand for feminine labor outside the home.

The telephone, which now connects towns and cities and villages in Japan, employs girls in large numbers. In the printing-offices we find women at work, not as compositors, but as compositors' assistants, darting from case to case about the room and selecting for the compositor the ideographs that he needs in his work. Inasmuch as a small printing-office cannot get along with less than four thousand characters, and as larger ones may have several times that number, the need of quick-witted and quick-footed assistants to each compositor may be easily recognized. As the schools turn out each year more girls fitted by education to do this kind of work, and as the number of newspapers and other printed matter is continually on the increase, the demand for and supply of this special variety of labor are likely to increase proportionately for some time to come.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000654\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000654\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>A few women are now making their way as reporters on the daily papers, a<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> few more are engaged in literary work. One of the best of modern Japanese novelists was a woman, but she died several years ago at so early an age that her work was a promise rather than a fulfillment. Artists, too, there are, who are making names for themselves, as well as a living, in a country where art is so common that success in that line means hard work and special talent. A few young women support themselves by stenography, a few more as clerks and secretaries in business offices. Until a writing-machine has been invented that will write four thousand characters, there will not be much demand for typewriter girls in Japan outside of the treaty ports, where a few are now employed. The Japanese government has found, as Uncle Sam discovered some time ago, that for the counting of paper money women's fingers are more deft than those of men, and it consequently gives employment to a few women in that work. One railroad has recently begun to employ women as ticket-sellers, and three medical schools have already graduated some women physicians,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> though it is still doubtful whether there is any great opening for them in the country. These are some of the ways in which women now find themselves able to gain a little more independence of life. The whole matter is so new that no statistics are available that will show the exact extent of the demand for labor in these directions, but from my own observation I am inclined to think that there is little change in the employments of women except in the neighborhood of the larger cities, and that the new occupations as yet have a very slight effect upon the conditions in this country at large.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000655\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000655\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>It is not possible to understand the actual progress made in Japan in improving the condition of women, without some consideration of the effect that Christian thought and Christian lives have had on the thought and lives of the modern Japanese.

The statistics of missionary effort show a steady, though slight, increase in the number of professing Christians, but if the sum total of the results of missionary effort were the number of converts made, it might, perhaps, be doubtful whether the money spent on missions in Japan might not be better turned to other purposes. There are now in Japan, of Christians of all sects, Protestant, and Roman and Greek Catholic, 121,000, or about one half of one per cent. of the total population of the country; but the influence of these Christians as leaders of thought is out of all proportion to their number. Christian men are found in the Diet, in the army and navy, in the universities and colleges, and in the newspaper offices, in a proportion far beyond their ratio to the total population, <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>exerting their influence in many ways for the uplifting of the nation to loftier moral ideals. The proportion of Christian men and women in the government schools with which I have been connected is rather surprising. In the Higher Normal School, training young women to go out into the whole country as teachers, the proportion of professing Christians upon the teaching staff is striking; and in the Peeresses' School, which is as conservative and anti-foreign as any educational institution in Japan, there are five professing Christians among the thirty-five teachers. While, on the one hand, the Japanese Christians are not all models of all the virtues, while there is with many of them a tendency to modify their Christianity so as to accommodate a considerable amount of worldly wisdom, it is true, on the other hand, that the most active workers in the cause of philanthropy are men who have accepted the Christian faith, and who are striving in all earnestness to model their lives after the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The Christian Church in Japan to-day has its heroes and its back-sliders, <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>and has between these two extremes a rank and file of every-day, commonplace men and women, who amidst frequent failures and in the midst of many temptations are making the name of Christian stand for a certain kind of life and a certain standard of virtue quite above and beyond the lives and standards of their countrymen. It is largely because of them that a Christian public opinion is growing up among non-Christian Japanese. Men to-day who have no special leanings toward Christianity shake their heads over vices and sins which a few years ago were not even thought of as wrong. There is a great deal of talk about the growth of moral depravity in the country, but as a matter of fact, the standards of virtue have never been so high since Japan was opened as they are to-day: it is only that Christian thought has held up a mirror to an un-Christian society, in which it views all too clearly its own defects. There is, to my mind, no more hopeful sign of the times than the growing discouragement over the present condition of morals. When there is added to this<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> a steadily increasing respect for the honesty and strength of character of Christian men and women, it must mean that a great and lasting impression has been made. To-day banks, business offices, and other places requiring trustworthy clerks and employees, prefer, other things being equal, Christian young men, for it is generally known that they are more worthy of confidence than the majority of applicants for such places.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000657\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000657\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>One instance of this increased moral sensitiveness may be cited in the recent successful efforts to limit the power of the brothel-keepers over their victims and virtual slaves, the <i>jōrō</i> or licensed prostitutes. As I have stated in a previous chapter, the women who carry on this business in Japan are, many of them, unwilling victims of a system which allows parents to sell their children to a life of shame; and they enter upon that life so young that they can hardly be regarded as morally responsible for their condition. Even after the actual sale of girls was forbidden by an imperial ordinance in 1872, the purchase price was called a loan to the parents of the girl,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> and subsequent loans for clothing entered upon the books of the establishment kept the unfortunates so continually in debt to their masters that they could never escape from the bondage in which they were held except through death, or by purchase by some infatuated admirer. Public opinion, while it indulged in some sentimental pity for the hard lot of the <i>jōrō</i>, did little or nothing to aid any one who desired to help them, regarding the profession as a necessary one, and caring not at all for the injustice to which the girls were subjected. Ten or twelve years ago, a movement started by some prominent Japanese Christians against the <i>jōroya</i> fell flat for want of a public opinion behind it. Speeches on the subject were hissed down by audiences of young men, and nothing could be done to help even the most innocent and unhappy of the girls to a better life. In the new code, perhaps as an effect of this movement, a new law provided that the <i>jōrō</i> might leave her calling by giving notice to the police. A police regulation, however, forbade any girl to cease her employment, or to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> leave the house in which she was kept, unless her official notice of cessation was countersigned by the keeper of the <i>jōroya</i>, so that by her own effort she could not free herself.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000658\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000658\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the year 1900, one of these girls in a provincial city appealed to an American missionary for help in getting her liberty.

Thus the war began, but the Tōkyō police took up the matter, the Tōkyō press joined hands with the Salvationists, and in the end the whole country was stirred to aid in the attack. In return, the brothel-keepers and their employees, feeling that the profits of their business were at stake, made it extremely warm for any Salvationists or newspaper reporters who dared set foot in the disreputable quarters, and in their zeal sometimes made mistakes and drove out their would-be patrons.

The new regulations made the descent to Avernus as difficult as possible, and the return to the upper world a mere step. In Tōkyō alone, in the first four months after the promulgation of this order, 1,100 out of the 6,335 girls who were licensed as prostitutes left the houses in which they were employed, most of them returning to their homes and families, and as many as applied being cared for in the Rescue Home of the Salvation Army.

The disestablishment of the Buddhist church by the government at the time of the restoration must be credited with its share of the awakening process; for the priests, finding their own support and that of the temples dependent upon the voluntary contributions of worshipers, were forced to bestir themselves as they had not done since the old missionary days, when they were working for a foothold in the country. But without the competition of Christianity, it is extremely doubtful whether their efforts would have been turned so largely along educational and philanthropic lines, whether the standard of intelligence among the priesthood<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> would have been so quickly raised, whether they would have sent young men abroad to study Sanskrit and history with a view to a better understanding of their own scriptures, or whether they would not rather have relied on less radical methods of quickening the religious life within their body. Certain it is that Buddhism, which upon its introduction into Japan actually lowered the status of women, is now making a bid for public favor by holding meetings and founding societies especially for women, and is doing its best to increase their self-respect and the respect in which they are held by society.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000671\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000671\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>An interesting story which throws some light upon the new influence that is at work among the Buddhists came to me not long ago through a Japanese friend. There were two brothers living in a poor little village on the northern coast of Japan, who were joint heirs to a small piece of property. As the land was not enough for the support of two families, the elder brother, a gentle, thoughtful youth, gave up all title to his share of the inheritance and entered a Buddhist<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> monastery. In the quiet of this retreat, amid the beautiful surroundings, the daily services, the chanting of priests, and the mellow booming of the great monastery bell, his thoughts went out to the poor and the sinful among his own people. He began to feel that a life which seeks merely spiritual uplift for itself is not the highest life, and that only as spiritual gain is shared with others is it real and lasting. Forthwith he began a life of helpfulness to the poor about him,—of teaching and preaching and good deeds that won him many humble friends. Within the monastery, however, his work was not approved. His ideas and actions were not in harmony with the teachings of the sect. He was first disciplined and then expelled, and found his way back at last, penniless, to his native village.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000672\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000672\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Now, in northern Japan the winters are long and hard, and the most industrious of farmers and fisher-folk can wring only a bare subsistence from the conditions of their toil. It is from these villages, perhaps, more than from any other sources, that the girls are obtained to<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> supply the <i>jōroya</i> of the great cities. At any rate, in this particular village, the only hope that any girl possessed of escaping from the hard home toil was by the sale of her person, and the thought of seeing the great cities, of wearing beautiful dresses, of being admired and petted, and perhaps at last of marrying some rich lover and becoming a great lady, was a tempting bait to these poor peasant girls. To this young man, whose soul had been awakened to a new sensitiveness during his absence, the full horror of the conditions that could so warp and dwarf the souls of women appealed as it had never done before. He must do something to help them, but what to do his previous experience did not help him to know. He sought for aid and sympathy in his native place, among his friends and co-religionists; but the state of affairs was too old and too familiar to excite interest, and at last he worked his way to the capital, feeling that somewhere in that great city he would find light on the question that perplexed him. It was a mere question of ways and means—how to begin a work which he<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> felt driven from within to do. In Tōkyō, as he inquired among his friends, he was told that Christians knew all about the kind of work that he wished to begin, that he must go to them and study their methods, if he would help the people of his native village. So the devout young Buddhist, who had found in his own faith the divine impulse, turned to the study of what Christians had done and were doing for the unfortunate. The story is not finished yet. We cannot tell whether in the end it will result in another addition to the ranks of the Japanese Christians, or whether it will aid in the quickening that has come to Buddhism, but, whatever way it ends, it shows in a concrete example what Christianity is now doing for Japan, and especially for the women of the country.</p></div>\"\n        },\n

In some families the boys are called by names indicating their position in the family, the words <i>Taro</i>, &quot;Big one,&quot; <i>Jiro</i>, &quot;Second one,&quot; <i>Saburo</i>, &quot;Third one,&quot; <i>Shiro</i>, &quot;Fourth one,&quot; <i>Goro</i>, &quot;Fifth one,&quot; etc., being used alone, or placed after adjectives indicating some quality that it is hoped the child may possess. Such combinations are, <i>Eitaro</i>, &quot;Glorious big one,&quot; <i>Seijiro</i>, &quot;Pure second one,&quot; <i>Tomisaburo</i>, &quot;Rich third one,&quot; and so on.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000698\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000698\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><h3><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000069\\\"><i>Page</i> 4.</$link></h3></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000699\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000699\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>To speak with greater exactness, the <i>miya mairi</i> of a boy is on the thirty-first day of his life,—of a girl, on the thirty-third.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000700\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000700\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000701\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000701\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><h3><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000074\\\"><i>Page</i> 8.</$link></h3></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000702\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000702\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Tōkyō just now shows a tendency to change this national custom.

The conservatives <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>point with scorn to this girl whose new ideas have led her into folly or trouble, or to that one whose health has been broken down by the adverse conditions surrounding her student life, and say, &quot;This will be the case with all our women if we continue this insane practice of educating them along new lines.&quot; Advance in female education, as in all other lines of progress in Japan, is a series of violent actions and reactions. In 1889, partly through ill-advised conduct on the part of supporters of the cause, one of the most serious reverses that has come in the progress of Western education for women began to show itself. The reaction was helped along by a paper read before some of the most influential men of Japan, and subsequently reported and discussed in the newspapers, by a German professor in the medical department of the imperial University in Tōkyō. The paper was a serious warning to the men of the country that no women could be good wives, mothers, and housekeepers and at the same time have undergone a thorough literary education. The arguments were reinforced by statistics showing that American college women either did not marry, or that if they married they had very few children. All Japan took fright at this alarming showing, and for several years the education of girls in anything more than the primary studies was not encouraged by<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> the government. The lowest depth of this reaction was reached during or soon after the Japan-China war, when the growth of national vanity resulted in a temporary disdain for all foreign ideas. The tide has turned again now, girls' schools that have been closed for years are being reopened, young men who are thinking of marrying are looking for educated wives, and among the women themselves there is a strong desire for self-improvement. Under this impulse a new generation of educated women will be added to those already exerting an influence in the country, and it is to be hoped that the forward movement will be more difficult to set back when the next reactionary wave strikes the Japanese coast.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000734\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000734\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><h3><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000214\\\"><i>Page</i> 60.</$link></h3></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000735\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000735\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The <i>obi</i> is supposed to express by its length the hope that the marriage may be an enduring one.

The bride who goes to her husband's house well provided by her own family, will carry, not only a full wardrobe and the house-furnishings already mentioned, but will be supplied, so far as foresight can manage it, with all the little things that she can need for months in advance. Paper, pens, ink, postage stamps, needles, thread, and sewing materials of all kinds, a store of dress materials and other things to be given as presents<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> to any and all who may do her favors, and pocket money with which she may make good any deficiencies, or meet any unforeseen emergency. When she goes from her father's house, she should be so thoroughly fitted out that she will not have to ask her husband for the smallest thing for a number of months. The parents of the bride, in giving up their daughter, as they do when she marries, show the estimation in which they have held her by the beauty and completeness of the trousseau with which they provide her. The expense of this wedding outfit is often very great, persons even in the most moderate circumstances spending as much as one thousand yen upon the necessary purchases, and among the wealthy, four thousand to five thousand yen is not extravagant. As material wealth increases in Japan, there is a marked tendency to increase the style and cost of the trousseau, and the marriage of a daughter has come to be, in many cases, a severe strain on the family finances. But this outfit is of the nature of a dowry, for it is her very own; and in the event of a divorce, she brings back with her to her father's house the clothing and household goods that she carried away as a bride.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000740\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000740\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><h3><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000176\\\"><i>Page</i> 64.</$link></h3></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000741\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000741\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>For this visit the bride wears for the first time a dress made for her by her husband's family and<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> bearing its crest, as a sign that she is now a member of that family and only a guest in her father's house.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000742\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000742\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><h3><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000195\\\"><i>Page</i> 76.</$link></h3></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000743\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000743\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Since the adoption of the new code, the conditions of marriage and of divorce have been altered for the better. At present no divorce is possible except through the courts or through mutual consent; the simple change of registration by one party or the other does not constitute a legal divorce. Even a divorce by mutual consent cannot be arranged without the consent of the parents or head of the family of a married person who is under twenty-five years of age. The grounds upon which judicial divorce may be granted seem very trivial measured by European standards, but, on the other hand, they are a distinct gain over the former practice. The wife is no longer dependent for her position simply upon the whim of her husband, but, unless he can secure her consent to the separation, he must formulate charges of immorality or conviction of crime, or of cruel treatment or grave insult on the part of the wife or of her relatives, or of desertion, or of disappearance for a period of three years or more. Only when some such charge has been made and proved before a court can a husband send away his wife. In the case<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> of a separation by mutual consent, though the law still gives the care of the children to the father in case no previous agreement has been made, if a woman sees her way clear to supporting them, she may stipulate for the custody of one or more of them as a condition of her consent to the divorce. In a judicial divorce, the judge may, in the interests of the children, take them away from their father and assign them to the care of some other person.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000744\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000744\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In these changes we can see a distinct advance toward permanence of the family tie; and we can see, too, that the wife has gained a new power to hold her own against injustice and wrong.

While no departure was made from the old precedents in the selection of a Princess from one of the five families that trace their descent from Jimmu Tenno, the whole manner of obtaining the bride was different from anything that Japan had before known. The Prince asked the father of the young lady to give her to him just as a common man might have done, and everything in the preliminary arrangements was carried out with the idea that by the marriage she was to be raised to his rank and position.

Instead of the curtained seclusion, the quiet and calm of the old palace in the old capital, the present Crown Prince has known from babyhood the sights and sounds of the stirring city of Tōkyō. He has driven in an open carriage or walked through its streets; he has been to school with boys of his own age, taking the school work and<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> the drill and the games with the other boys, learning to know men and things and himself too, in a way in which none of his ancestors, since the days when they were simply savage chiefs, have had opportunity of knowing. As he grew toward manhood, his delicate health required that he leave the school and pursue his studies as his strength permitted, under masters; but he has retained his love for all athletic exercises, for dogs and horses and guns and bicycles, and he is as expert in outdoor sports as any youth of Western training. His mind is quick and eager, interested especially in foreign ways and thoughts, and seeking most of all to understand how other people think and feel and live. Though he has been emancipated to a wonderful degree from the state and ceremony that surrounded his ancestors, he is nevertheless impatient of what remains, and would gladly dispense with many forms that his conservative guardians regard as necessary; and these same guardians at times find their young eaglet difficult to manage. He has views and ideas of his own, and acts occasionally upon his own initiative in a way that fairly scandalizes his advisers. He wishes to visit his future subjects upon something like equal terms. The rôle of Son of Heaven seems to him less interesting at times than some smaller and more human part. When he walks, he wants<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> to lead his own dog, not have him led by some one else; to stop in the street and watch the common people at their work; to drop in on his friends in a neighborly way and see how they live when they are not expecting a visit from royalty. Provided he does not go too fast or too far, when his turn comes to ascend the throne, he cannot but make a better emperor for the intimate personal knowledge that he is seeking and gaining of the lives and feelings of his people.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000764\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000764\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The Crown Princess Sada, who has now been for one year in the line of succession to the present beloved Empress, shows in her training and character the influence of the new impulse that is driving Japan forward. The circumstances that led to her selection as the bride of the Prince are in themselves curious enough to be worth recording. The Kujo family is one of the five families from which alone can the wife of the Crown Prince be chosen, and the present Prince Kujo is blessed with many daughters. Of these, the oldest is about the age of Prince Haru, and at one time it was hoped that she might be selected as his consort, but at last that hope was given up, and she was married to another prince. The second daughter was as bright and charming as the first, but she was just enough younger than the Prince to make her marriage with him so dangerous a matter according to all the rules that<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> govern good and bad luck in Japan, that no hope was entertained for her, and she was married, when her time came, with no reference to the greatest match that any Japanese princess can make. The third daughter was six years younger than the Prince, so much younger that it was thought that he would be married long before she grew up, so no special care or attention was given to her. In her babyhood, like most Japanese babies of high rank, she was sent out into the country to be nursed. Her foster parents were plain farmer folk, who loved her and cared for her as their own child. She played bareheaded and barefooted in the sun and wind, tumbled about, jolly and happy, with the village children, and lived and grew like a kitten or a puppy rather than like a future empress until she was old enough for the kindergarten. Then she came back to Tōkyō, to her father's house, and from there she attended the Peeresses' School, going backward and forward every day with her bundle of books, and taking her share of the work and play with the other children. In her school-days she was noticeable for her great physical activity and her hearty enjoyment of the outdoor sports which form so important a part of the training in Japanese schools for girls at present; and for her strength of will and character among a class of students upon whom self-repression<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> amounting almost to self-abnegation has been inculcated from earliest childhood.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000765\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000765\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>When this little princess reached the age of fifteen, the Crown Prince's marriage, which had been somewhat deferred on account of his ill-health, was pressed forward, and to the extreme surprise of her own family, and of many others as well, the Princess Sada was chosen, largely on account of her great physical vigor. Then began a great change in her life. From being one of the lowest and least considered in her family, she was suddenly raised high above all the rest, even her father addressing her as a superior. The merry, romping school-girl was transformed in a few days into the great lady, too grand to associate on equal terms with any but the imperial family. Small cause was there for wonder if she shrank from the change and begged that the honor might be bestowed on some one else. The old free life was gone forever, and she dreaded the heavy responsibility that was to fall upon her slender shoulders.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000766\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000766\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The choice was made in August, 1899, and from the moment that the engagement was entered into, the Princess Sada became an honored guest in her father's house.

A new and handsome suite of rooms was built for her,<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> her old wardrobe was discarded and an entirely new one provided for her, all her table service was new and distinct from that of the rest of the family, and she was addressed by all as if she were already Empress. Her studies were not given up, but masters were chosen for her who came to her and instructed her, with due deference to her high station, in the subjects that she had been studying at school. So passed the nine months of her engagement, and on May 8, 1900, she became one of the principals in a state wedding such as Japan had never before seen. Through all the show and ceremony she acquitted herself decorously and bravely, and since her marriage no word save of approval of the young wife has come out from the palace gates. Her little sisters-in-law, the four small daughters of the Emperor, enjoy nothing so much as to go and spend the day with her, for she is so amusing, and her life has been such a busy and happy one, that she comes like a breath of fresh air into the seclusion of the Court. Her young husband, too, finds in her congenial society, and his frail health seems to be daily strengthening with the brightness that has come into his home.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000767\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000767\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Great was the joy in the empire when, on April 29, 1901, this happy union was rendered still happier by the birth of a strong little prince to carry on the ancient line.

The carp is to the Japanese mind the emblem of courage and perseverance, for he swims up the strongest current, leaping the waterfalls that oppose his progress. The baby was named by his grandfather, and will have the personal name of Hirohito, and the title Prince Michi. With this new little prince there are no polite fictions to maintain, nor conventional relationships to be established. He is the son of his father's lawful wife, as well as of his father. There is to be no breaking off of natural ties, and his own mother will nurse and care for him, a fortune that never falls to the lot of the imperial son of a <i>mékaké</i>.

Most of the ordinary English field games—tennis, basket-ball, etc.—are played with skill and vigor, and in addition to these there are races of various kinds, devised to show, not simply fleetness of foot, but quickness of hand and wit as well. These races vary from year to year, as the ingenuity of the directors of the sports may be able to devise new forms of exercise. One extremely pretty contest is as follows: On the playground between the starting-point and the goal are set at equal distances four upright sticks for each runner. Four branches of cherry blossoms and four bright-colored ribbons for each contestant are laid on the ground at the starting-point. At the signal, each girl picks up a cherry branch and a ribbon, and runs to one of the upright sticks, tying the flowers firmly thereto;<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> then she runs back for a second branch, and so on until all four have been fastened in place. The race is won by the child who first reaches the goal leaving behind her four blooming trees where before there were bare poles. This seems to be the æsthetic Japanese equivalent for our prosaic potato race. Another contest is after this manner: Along the course of each runner are laid at certain intervals bright-colored balls,—a different color for each contestant. The object of the race is, within a certain time, to pick up all the balls and throw them into the nearly closed mouth of a great net at the far end of the grounds. The contest is not decided until the balls have been counted, when the girl who has succeeded in getting the greatest number of balls of her color into the net is declared the winner. Another and extremely pretty race, calling for great steadiness of hand and body, is the running from one end of the ground to the other with a ball balanced on a battledore. The Japanese battledore is made of light but hard wood, and is long and narrow in shape. If one had not seen it done, it would be well-nigh impossible to believe that any child could carry a ball upon it for more than a few slow steps: but these children run at a smart trot, keeping the ball immovable upon its small and smooth surface.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000771\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000771\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Beside the games and races, there are calisthenic <a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a>exhibitions, in which great precision of motion and flexibility of body are manifested.

It was only a few years ago that the son had begun to help in the family support, and to be able to repay to the mother her tender care of him. Her pride in her son and his young wife was a pleasure to see, and the little home they had together seemed a safe haven for the coming years of old age. Now, in a moment all this was changed,—the son must start off for the wars. Yet not for one instant was a cloud seen on the mother's face, as, smilingly and cheerfully, she assisted in the preparations for his departure. Not in public or in secret did one sigh or regret escape her; not even to the son did a word of anxiety pass her lips.

Sending away her servant on some excuse, she remained alone in her home, which she put into perfect order. Then she arranged all her papers, wrote a number of letters, and made her last preparations for death. She dressed herself in full ceremonial dress as she had been dressed for her bridal, and seated herself before a large portrait of her husband. Then, with a short dirk, such as is owned by every samurai woman, she stabbed herself. In her last letters she gives as the reason for her death that, having no ties in the world, she would not survive her husband, but wished to remain faithful to him in death as she had been in life.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000786\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000786\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>&quot;Many such stories might be cited, but enough has been given to show the spirit that exists in Japan.

The fact is that neither civilization has as yet come into any understanding of the other's æsthetic side, and the sense of beauty of the one is a sealed book to the other. The Japanese nation, in its efforts to adopt foreign ways, has been, up to the present time, blindly imitating, with little or no comprehension of underlying principles.

Here and there in Tōkyō may be seen buildings in which the solidity of foreign architecture has been grafted upon the Japanese type. Ten years ago, Japanese men who adopted foreign dress went about in misfitting garments, soiled linen, untidy shoes, and hats that had been discarded by the civilization for which they were made many seasons before they reached Japan. They wore Turkish towels about their necks and red blankets over their shoulders at the desire of unscrupulous importers, who persuaded them that towels for neck-cloths and blankets for overcoats were the latest styles of London and Paris. To-day one sees no such eccentricities of costume in the purely Japanese city of Tōkyō. Men who wear foreign dress wear it made correctly in every particular by Japanese tailors, shoemakers, and hatters. The standard has been attained, for men at least, and in foreign dress as well as in Japanese, the natural good taste of the people has begun to assert itself. So it will be in time with other new things adopted. As no single element of the Chinese civilization secured a permanent footing in Japan except such as could be adapted, not only to the national life, but to the national taste as well, so it will be with European things. All things that are adopted will be adapted, and<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> whatever is adapted is likely in time to be improved and made more beautiful by the national instinct for beauty. During the transition, enormities are omitted and monstrosities are constructed, but when the standard is at last attained, we may expect that the genius of the race will triumph over the difficulties that it is now encountering. Individual Japanese who have lived long in Europe or America show the same nice discrimination in regard to foreign things that they do in their Japanese surroundings, and are rarely at fault in their taste. What is true of the individual now will be true of the nation when European standards have become common property.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000791\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000791\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><h3><$link class=\\\"pginternal\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000486\\\"><i>Page</i> 242.</$link></h3></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000792\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000792\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In the remote mountain regions, where the majesty and uncertainty of the great natural forces impress themselves constantly upon the minds of the peasantry, one finds a simple nature worship, and a desire to propitiate all the unseen powers, that is not so evident in the daily life of the dwellers in more populous and progressive parts of the country.

In places where pack-horses form a large part of the wealth of the people, stones to the horses' spirits are erected, and the halters of all the horses that die are left upon these stones. Prayers, too, are offered to the guardian spirits of the living horses, before stones on which are carved sometimes the image of a horse bearing a <i>gohei</i> on his back, sometimes a rough figure of the horse-headed Kwannon. To such stones or shrines are brought horses suffering from sickness of any kind, and the hand is rubbed first on the stone and then on the part of the animal supposed to be affected.

Our walks were rather limited in variety, as the village lay in an almost inaccessible mountain valley through which a carefully engineered road ran along the edge of the river gorge. About half a mile out of the village, close to the road and overhanging the waters of the river at a spot where the rocks were so worn and carved by the rushing torrent<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> as to have gained the appropriate title of the &quot;Screen Rocks,&quot; was a little shop and a tea-house. It was a pleasant resting-place after a warm and dusty walk, and almost daily we would halt there for a cup of tea and a slice of <i>yokan</i>, or bean marmalade, before returning to our rooms in the hotel. The managers of the place were an old man and his wife, who divided their labor between the shop and the tea-house. The old man was an artist in roots. His life was devoted to searching out grotesquely shaped roots on the forest-covered hills, and whittling, turning, and trimming them into the semblance of animal or human forms. <i>Tengu</i> and goblins, long-legged birds and short-legged beasts, all manner of weird products of his imagination and his handiwork, peopled the interior of the little shop, and he was always ready to welcome us and show us his latest work, with the pride of an artist in his masterpiece.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000794\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000794\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>His wife, a cheery old woman, attended to the tea-house, and as soon as we had seated ourselves, bustled about to bring us cool water from the spring that bubbled out of the rocks across the road, and to set before us the tiny cups of straw-colored tea and the delicious slices of <i>yokan</i> which we soon learned was the specialty of the place. She was glad to have a little gossip as we sipped and nibbled, telling us many interesting bits of<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> folklore about the immediate locality. It was from her that we learned that the pinnacle of rock that dominated the village was built by <i>tengu</i> long ago, though now they were all gone from the woods, for she had looked for them often at night when she went out to shut the house, but she had never seen one,—and even the monkeys were becoming scarce. She it was, too, who sent us to look for the mysterious draught of cold air that crossed the road near the base of the great rock, colder on hot days than on cool ones, and at all times astonishing,—the &quot;Tengu's Wind Hole.&quot; We learned through her about the snakes to be found in the woods, and of the wonderful tonic virtues of the <i>mamushi</i> (the one poisonous snake of Japan), if caught and bottled with a sufficient quantity of <i>saké</i>. The <i>saké</i> may be renewed again and again, and the longer the snake has been bottled the more medicinal does it become, so that one <i>mamushi</i> may, if used perseveringly, medicate several casks of <i>saké</i>. We had opportunity later to verify her statements, for we found at a small grocery store, where we stopped to add a few delicacies to our somewhat scanty bill of fare, two snakes, neatly coiled in quart bottles and pickled in <i>saké</i>, one of which could be obtained for the sum of seventy-five sen, though the other, who in his rage at being bottled had buried his fangs in his own body, commanded a higher<a class=\\\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\\\"></a> price because of his courage. We did not feel in need of a tonic that day, so left the <i>mamushi</i> on the grocery shelves, but it is probable that their disintegrating remains are being industriously quaffed to-day by some elderly Japanese whose failing strength demands an unfailing remedy.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000795\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/6a4248ca8f6e64ca/text/000000795\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-9c6670 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-e3b0c4 twpub-6a4248ca8f6e64ca-6b4cd0\\\"><p>When our little friend had learned of our interest in snakes, she was on the lookout for snake stories of all kinds.

She had seen him before, herself, so he was no novelty to her, but she was sure that the matter would interest us.

This was no laughing matter, as the bride was of a noble family and the breaking of the engagement would be attended with much talk and trouble on both sides; but, on the other hand, the family of the bridegroom dared not face the danger so mysteriously prophesied by the fortune-teller. In this predicament, there was nothing to do but to pull the wool over the eyes of the gods as best they might. For this purpose the bride with all her belongings was sent the day before the wedding from her father's house to that of an uncle living in another part of the city, and on the morning of the wedding-day she came to her husband from a quarter quite favorable to his fortunes.

part of this Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to\\n<br>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property\\n<br>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all\\n<br>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy\\n<br>all copies of Project

a registered trademark.  It may only be\\n<br>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who\\n<br>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few\\n<br>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n<br>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See\\n<br>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement\\n<br>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\n<br>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&quot;the Foundation&quot;\\n<br>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the\\n<br>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an\\n<br>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are\\n<br>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from\\n<br>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative\\n<br>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg\\n<br>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by\\n<br>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of\\n<br>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with\\n<br>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by\\n<br>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\\n<br>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in\\n<br>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check\\n<br>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement\\n<br>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or\\n<br>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning\\n<br>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United\\n<br>States.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with

the\\n<br>phrase &quot;Project Gutenberg&quot; appears, or with which the phrase &quot;Project\\n<br>Gutenberg&quot; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,\\n<br>copied or distributed:\\n<br>\\n<br>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\\n<br>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or\\n<br>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\\n<br>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived\\n<br>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is\\n<br>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied\\n<br>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees\\n<br>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work\\n<br>with the phrase &quot;Project Gutenberg&quot; associated with or appearing on the\\n<br>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1\\n<br>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or\\n<br>1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted\\n<br>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution\\n<br>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional\\n<br>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked\\n<br>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the\\n<br>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this\\n<br>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this\\n<br>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without\\n<br>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with\\n<br>active links or immediate access to the full

ASCII&quot; or other format used in the official version\\n<br>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),\\n<br>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a\\n<br>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon\\n<br>request, of the work in its original &quot;Plain Vanilla ASCII&quot; or other\\n<br>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,\\n<br>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works\\n<br>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for

from\\n<br>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method\\n<br>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is\\n<br>     owed to the owner of the Project

within 60 days following each date on which you\\n<br>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax\\n<br>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and\\n<br>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the\\n<br>     address specified in Section 4, &quot;Information about donations to\\n<br>     the Project Gutenberg

formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\n<br>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\n<br>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\n<br>people in all walks of life.\\n<br>\\n<br>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\n<br>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\n<br>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\n<br>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\n<br>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\n<br>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
