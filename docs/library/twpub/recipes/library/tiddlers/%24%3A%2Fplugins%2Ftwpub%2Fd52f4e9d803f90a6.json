Is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand womenâthat the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mienâIF, indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the groundânay more, that it is at its last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very humanâall-too-human facts. The philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in still earlier times, in the service of which probably more labour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its &quot;super-terrestrial&quot; pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of architecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kindâfor instance, the Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome, and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist errorânamely, Plato's invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself. But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthierâsleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the PERSPECTIVEâthe fundamental conditionâof life, to speak of Spirit and the Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: &quot;How did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked Socrates really corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of youths, and deserved his hemlock?&quot; But the struggle against Plato, orâto speak plainer, and for the &quot;people&quot;âthe struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity (FOR CHRISTIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE &quot;PEOPLE&quot;), produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals. As a matter of fact, the European feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by means of Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic enlightenmentâwhich, with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit would not so easily find itself in &quot;distress&quot;! (The Germans invented gunpowderâall credit to them! but they again made things squareâthey invented printing.) But we, who are neither Jesuits, nor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS, and free, VERY free spiritsâwe have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who knows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT....</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000024\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000024\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Sils Maria Upper Engadine, JUNE, 1885.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000025\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000025\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p><br>\\n<br></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000026\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000026\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\">\\n\\n</div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000027\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000027\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p><br>\\n<br>\\n<a></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000028\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000028\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c2\\\"><br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000029\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000029\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><h2>CHAPTER I.

The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really is this &quot;Will to Truth&quot; in us? In fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this Willâuntil at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth presented itself before usâor was it we who presented ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000031\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000031\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>2. &quot;HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest value must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR ownâin this transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the 'Thing-in-itselfâTHERE must be their source, and nowhere else!&quot;âThis mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this &quot;belief&quot; of theirs, they exert themselves for their &quot;knowledge,&quot; for something that is in the end solemnly christened &quot;the Truth.&quot; The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn vow, &quot;DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM.&quot; For it may be doubted, firstly, whether antitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their seal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from belowâ&quot;frog perspectives,&quot; as it were, to borrow an expression current among painters. In spite of all the value which may belong to the true, the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed thingsâperhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps! But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous &quot;Perhapses&quot;! For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of philosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the reverse of those hitherto prevalentâphilosophers of the dangerous &quot;Perhaps&quot; in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I see such new philosophers beginning to appear.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000032\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000032\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and &quot;innateness.&quot; As little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity, just as little is &quot;being-conscious&quot; OPPOSED to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite mode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than &quot;truth&quot; such valuations, in spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be only superficial valuations, special kinds of <i>niaiserie</i>, such as may be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves.

The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not liveâthat the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life.

That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they areâhow often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in short, how childish and childlike they are,âbut that there is not enough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner. They all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure, divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics, who, fairer and foolisher, talk of &quot;inspiration&quot;), whereas, in fact, a prejudiced proposition, idea, or &quot;suggestion,&quot; which is generally their heart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not wish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their prejudices, which they dub &quot;truths,&quot;âand VERY far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence and self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his &quot;categorical imperative&quot;âmakes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and maskâin fact, the &quot;love of HIS wisdom,&quot; to translate the term fairly and squarelyâin order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden, that Pallas Athene:âhow much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000035\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000035\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted ofânamely, the confession of its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown. Indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first ask oneself: &quot;What morality do they (or does he) aim at?&quot; Accordingly, I do not believe that an &quot;impulse to knowledge&quot; is the father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate LORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to philosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in the case of really scientific men, it may be otherwiseâ&quot;better,&quot; if you will; there there may really be such a thing as an &quot;impulse to knowledge,&quot; some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. The actual &quot;interests&quot; of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another directionâin the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics; it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE IS,âthat is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000036\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000036\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense, and on the face of it, the word signifies &quot;Flatterers of Dionysius&quot;âconsequently, tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles; besides this, however, it is as much as to say, &quot;They are all ACTORS, there is nothing genuine about them&quot; (for Dionysiokolax was a popular name for an actor). And the latter is really the malignant reproach that Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were mastersâof which Epicurus was not a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos, who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three hundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who knows!

With all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwiseâand to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselvesâStoicism is self-tyrannyâNature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to &quot;creation of the world,&quot; the will to the causa prima.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000040\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000040\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with which the problem of &quot;the real and the apparent world&quot; is dealt with at present throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and he who hears only a &quot;Will to Truth&quot; in the background, and nothing else, cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. In rare and isolated cases, it may really have happened that such a Will to Truthâa certain extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the forlorn hopeâhas participated therein: that which in the end always prefers a handful of &quot;certainty&quot; to a whole cartload of beautiful possibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience, who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an uncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing, mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a virtue may display. It seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. In that they side AGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of &quot;perspective,&quot; in that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the ocular evidence that &quot;the earth stands still,&quot; and thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than in one's body?),âwho knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession, something of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the &quot;immortal soul,&quot; perhaps &quot;the old God,&quot; in short, ideas by which they could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by &quot;modern ideas&quot;? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the most varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness. Therein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and knowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels them from MODERN reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde by-paths concern us! The main thing about them is NOT that they wish to go &quot;back,&quot; but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom.

It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; with it in his hand he said: &quot;This is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.&quot; Let us only understand this &quot;could be&quot;! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible somethingâat all events &quot;new faculties&quot;âof which to be still prouder!âBut let us reflect for a momentâit is high time to do so. &quot;How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE?&quot; Kant asks himselfâand what is really his answer? &quot;BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)&quot;âbut unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further discovered a moral faculty in manâfor at that time Germans were still moral, not yet dabbling in the &quot;Politics of hard fact.&quot; Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of the Tubingen institution went immediately into the grovesâall seeking for &quot;faculties.&quot; And what did they not findâin that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between &quot;finding&quot; and &quot;inventing&quot;! Above all a faculty for the &quot;transcendental&quot;; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition, and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally pious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral indignation. Enough, howeverâthe world grew older, and the dream vanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still rub them today. People had been dreaming, and first and foremostâold Kant. &quot;By means of a means (faculty)&quot;âhe had said, or at least meant to say. But, is thatâan answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? &quot;By means of a means (faculty),&quot; namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Moliere,</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000042\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000042\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"pgmonospaced\\\">Â Â Â  Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,\\n<br>Â Â Â  Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.\\n<br></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000043\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000043\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time to replace the Kantian question, &quot;How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI possible?&quot; by another question, &quot;Why is belief in such judgments necessary?&quot;âin effect, it is high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might naturally be false judgments!

Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view of life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which &quot;German philosophy&quot;âI hope you understand its right to inverted commas (goosefeet)?âhas exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to German philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, the mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the political obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into this, in shortâ&quot;sensus assoupire.&quot;...</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000044\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000044\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression)âthanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that &quot;stood fast&quot; of the earthâthe belief in &quot;substance,&quot; in &quot;matter,&quot; in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife, against the &quot;atomistic requirements&quot; which still lead a dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated &quot;metaphysical requirements&quot;: one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of &quot;the soul&quot; thereby, and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypothesesâas happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as &quot;mortal soul,&quot; and &quot;soul of subjective multiplicity,&quot; and &quot;soul as social structure of the instincts and passions,&quot; want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In that the NEW psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrustâit is possible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENTâand, who knows? perhaps to DISCOVER the new.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000045\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000045\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>13.

It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as moreânamely, as an explanation. It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastesâin fact, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism. What is clear, what is &quot;explained&quot;? Only that which can be seen and feltâone must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidenceâperhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the sensesâthe mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT different from that which the physicists of today offer usâand likewise the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers, with their principle of the &quot;smallest possible effort,&quot; and the greatest possible blunder. &quot;Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more for men to do&quot;âthat is certainly an imperative different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000047\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000047\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>15.

There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are &quot;immediate certainties&quot;; for instance, &quot;I think,&quot; or as the superstition of Schopenhauer puts it, &quot;I will&quot;; as though cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply as &quot;the thing in itself,&quot; without any falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the object. I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that &quot;immediate certainty,&quot; as well as &quot;absolute knowledge&quot; and the &quot;thing in itself,&quot; involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words! The people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher must say to himself: &quot;When I analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible: for instance, that it is <i>I</i> who think, that there must necessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,' and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinkingâthat I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'? In short, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with further 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me.&quot;âIn place of the &quot;immediate certainty&quot; in which the people may believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: &quot;Whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'? Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego' as cause of thought?&quot; He who ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like the person who says, &quot;I think, and know that this, at least, is true, actual, and certain&quot;âwill encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. &quot;Sir,&quot; the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, &quot;it is improbable that you are not mistaken, but why should it be the truth?&quot;</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000049\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000049\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>17. With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by these credulous mindsânamely, that a thought comes when &quot;it&quot; wishes, and not when &quot;I&quot; wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the case to say that the subject &quot;I&quot; is the condition of the predicate &quot;think.&quot; ONE thinks; but that this &quot;one&quot; is precisely the famous old &quot;ego,&quot; is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an &quot;immediate certainty.&quot; After all, one has even gone too far with this &quot;one thinks&quot;âeven the &quot;one&quot; contains an INTERPRETATION of the process, and does not belong to the process itself.

Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are in the habit of doingâhe seems to have adopted a POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be above all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in nameâand it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So let us for once be more cautious, let us be &quot;unphilosophical&quot;: let us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations, namely, the sensation of the condition &quot;AWAY FROM WHICH we go,&quot; the sensation of the condition &quot;TOWARDS WHICH we go,&quot; the sensation of this &quot;FROM&quot; and &quot;TOWARDS&quot; itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without our putting in motion &quot;arms and legs,&quot; commences its action by force of habit, directly we &quot;will&quot; anything. Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is a ruling thought;âand let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the &quot;willing,&quot; as if the will would then remain over! In the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the command. That which is termed &quot;freedom of the will&quot; is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: &quot;I am free, 'he' must obey&quot;âthis consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that &quot;this and nothing else is necessary now,&quot; the inward certainty that obedience will be renderedâand whatever else pertains to the position of the commander. A man who WILLS commands something within himself which renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. But now let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,âthis affair so extremely complex, for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term &quot;I&quot;: a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the act of willingâto such a degree that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action. Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the commandâconsequently obedience, and therefore actionâwas to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success. &quot;Freedom of Will&quot;âthat is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the orderâwho, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful &quot;underwills&quot; or under-soulsâindeed, our body is but a social structure composed of many soulsâto his feelings of delight as commander. L'EFFET C'EST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as already said, of a social structure composed of many &quot;souls&quot;, on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such within the sphere of moralsâregarded as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of &quot;life&quot; manifests itself.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000052\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000052\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>20. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as the collective members of the fauna of a Continentâis betrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of POSSIBLE philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something within them leads them, something impels them in definite order the one after the otherâto wit, the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order. The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where there is affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammarâI mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical functionsâit cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems, just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of world-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within the domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject is least developed) look otherwise &quot;into the world,&quot; and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.âSo much by way of rejecting Locke's superficiality with regard to the origin of ideas.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000053\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000053\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>21. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly. The desire for &quot;freedom of will&quot; in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of &quot;free will&quot; and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry his &quot;enlightenment&quot; a step further, and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of &quot;free will&quot;: I mean &quot;non-free will,&quot; which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. One should not wrongly MATERIALISE &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect,&quot; as the natural philosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at present), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it &quot;effects&quot; its end; one should use &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual understanding,âNOT for explanation. In &quot;being-in-itself&quot; there is nothing of &quot;casual-connection,&quot; of &quot;necessity,&quot; or of &quot;psychological non-freedom&quot;; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there &quot;law&quot; does not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence, reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world, as &quot;being-in-itself,&quot; with things, we act once more as we have always actedâMYTHOLOGICALLY. The &quot;non-free will&quot; is mythology; in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.âIt is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every &quot;causal-connection&quot; and &quot;psychological necessity,&quot; manifests something of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom; it is suspicious to have such feelingsâthe person betrays himself. And in general, if I have observed correctly, the &quot;non-freedom of the will&quot; is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their &quot;responsibility,&quot; their belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to THEIR merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS, no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a matter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as &quot;la religion de la souffrance humaine&quot;; that is ITS &quot;good taste.&quot;</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000054\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000054\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>22.

All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so far as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written, evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it. The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world, the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an injurious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has &quot;the heart&quot; against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad&quot; impulses, causes (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and manly conscienceâstill more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person should regard even the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and imperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present, fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand, if one has once drifted hither with one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our teeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm! We sail away right OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thitherâbut what do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who thus &quot;makes a sacrifice&quot;âit is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto, on the contrary!âwill at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. For psychology is once more the path to the fundamental problems.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000056\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000056\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000057\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000057\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c2\\\"><br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000058\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000058\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><h2>CHAPTER II.

Of suffering &quot;for the truth's sake&quot;! even in your own defense! It spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even worse consequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card as protectors of truth upon earthâas though &quot;the Truth&quot; were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, Messrs Loafers and Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye know sufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point; ye know that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out of the way! Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat feared! And pray, don't forget the garden, the garden with golden trellis-work! And have people around you who are as a gardenâor as music on the waters at eventide, when already the day becomes a memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free, wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means of force! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one, a long watching of enemies, of possible enemies! These pariahs of society, these long-pursued, badly-persecuted onesâalso the compulsory recluses, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunosâalways become in the end, even under the most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps without being themselves aware of it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-Brewers (just lay bare the foundation of Spinoza's ethics and theology!), not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. The martyrdom of the philosopher, his &quot;sacrifice for the sake of truth,&quot; forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him; and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a &quot;martyr,&quot; into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). Only, that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any caseâmerely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued proof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000061\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000061\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>26. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy, where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majorityâwhere he may forget &quot;men who are the rule,&quot; as their exception;âexclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. Whoever, in intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes; supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as such, he would one day have to say to himself: &quot;The devil take my good taste! but 'the rule' is more interesting than the exceptionâthan myself, the exception!&quot; And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would go &quot;inside.&quot; The long and serious study of the AVERAGE manâand consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad intercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one's equals):âthat constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge should be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task; I mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the commonplace and &quot;the rule&quot; in themselves, and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSESâsometimes they wallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out. There are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgustânamely, where by a freak of nature, genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the case of the Abbe Galiani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also filthiest man of his centuryâhe was far profounder than Voltaire, and consequently also, a good deal more silent. It happens more frequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an ape's body, a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors and moral physiologists. And whenever anyone speaks without bitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man as a belly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one sees, seeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any one speaks &quot;badly&quot;âand not even &quot;ill&quot;âof man, then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought, in general, to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. For the indignant man, and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, God, or society), may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and self-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more ordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case.

There are honestly meant translations, which, as involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the original, merely because its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and obviates all dangers in word and expression) could not also be rendered. A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language; consequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the most delightful and daring NUANCES of free, free-spirited thought. And just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience, so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything ponderous, viscous, and pompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying species of style, are developed in profuse variety among Germansâpardon me for stating the fact that even Goethe's prose, in its mixture of stiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the &quot;good old time&quot; to which it belongs, and as an expression of German taste at a time when there was still a &quot;German taste,&quot; which was a rococo-taste in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic nature, which understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was not the translator of Bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the Roman comedy-writersâLessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO, and flight out of Germany. But how could the German language, even in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli, who in his &quot;Principe&quot; makes us breathe the dry, fine air of Florence, and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo, perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to presentâlong, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and a TEMPO of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour? Finally, who would venture on a German translation of Petronius, who, more than any great musician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in invention, ideas, and words? What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil world, or of the &quot;ancient world,&quot; when like him, one has the feet of a wind, the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which makes everything healthy, by making everything RUN! And with regard to Aristophanesâthat transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed, provided one has understood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and transfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on PLATO'S secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no &quot;Bible,&quot; nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonicâbut a book of Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured lifeâa Greek life which he repudiatedâwithout an Aristophanes!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000064\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000064\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>29.

Our deepest insights mustâand shouldâappear as follies, and under certain circumstances as crimes, when they come unauthorizedly to the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. The exoteric and the esoteric, as they were formerly distinguished by philosophersâamong the Indians, as among the Greeks, Persians, and Mussulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of rank and NOT in equality and equal rightsâare not so much in contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and viewing, estimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not from the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in question views things from below upwardsâwhile the esoteric class views things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all the woe in the world were taken together, who would dare to decide whether the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy, and thus to a doubling of the woe?... That which serves the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely different and lower order of human beings. The virtues of the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he had sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for the soul and the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the higher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case they are dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they are herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery. Books for the general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry people clings to them. Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they reverence, it is accustomed to stink.

In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay. Everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, THE TASTE FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns to introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. The angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace, until it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able to vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even, is something falsifying and deceptive. Later on, when the young soul, tortured by continual disillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itselfâstill ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges itself for its long self-blinding, as though it had been a voluntary blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's sentiments; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the good conscience to be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses upon principle the cause AGAINST &quot;youth.&quot;âA decade later, and one comprehends that all this was also stillâyouth!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000067\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000067\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>32. Throughout the longest period of human historyâone calls it the prehistoric periodâthe value or non-value of an action was inferred from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China at present, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to its parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, &quot;Know thyself!&quot; was then still unknown.âIn the last ten thousand years, on the other hand, on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far, that one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin, decide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in &quot;origin,&quot; the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as the MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby made. Instead of the consequences, the originâwhat an inversion of perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a peculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention. The intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action: under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed, and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the present day.âIs it not possible, however, that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness and acuteness in manâis it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists, the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all that is seen, sensible, or &quot;sensed&quot; in it, belongs to its surface or skinâwhich, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still more? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom, which first requires an explanationâa sign, moreover, which has too many interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be surmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the self-mounting of moralityâlet that be the name for the long-secret labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright, and also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones of the soul.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000068\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000068\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>33. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be mercilessly called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics of &quot;disinterested contemplation,&quot; under which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.

At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays, seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon: we find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the &quot;nature of things.&quot; He, however, who makes thinking itself, and consequently &quot;the spirit,&quot; responsible for the falseness of the worldâan honourable exit, which every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself ofâhe who regards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as falsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do what it has always been doing? In all seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and respect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answers: for example, whether it be &quot;real&quot; or not, and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same description. The belief in &quot;immediate certainties&quot; is a MORAL NAIVETE which does honour to us philosophers; butâwe have now to cease being &quot;MERELY moral&quot; men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly which does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-ready distrust is regarded as the sign of a &quot;bad character,&quot; and consequently as an imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-class world and its Yeas and Nays, what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: the philosopher has at length a RIGHT to &quot;bad character,&quot; as the being who has hitherto been most befooled on earthâhe is now under OBLIGATION to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion.âForgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression; for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which philosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is nothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must be conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers, one wished to do away altogether with the &quot;seeming world&quot;âwell, granted that YOU could do that,âat least nothing of your &quot;truth&quot; would thereby remain! Indeed, what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;? Is it not enough to suppose degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of semblanceâdifferent valeurs, as the painters say? Why might not the world WHICH CONCERNS USâbe a fiction? And to any one who suggested: &quot;But to a fiction belongs an originator?&quot;âmight it not be bluntly replied: WHY? May not this &quot;belong&quot; also belong to the fiction? Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject, just as towards the predicate and object?

I do not mean as an illusion, a &quot;semblance,&quot; a &quot;representation&quot; (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions themselvesâas a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which afterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes (naturally also, refines and debilitates)âas a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions, including self-regulation, assimilation, nutrition, secretion, and change of matter, are still synthetically united with one anotherâas a PRIMARY FORM of life?âIn the end, it is not only permitted to make this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of LOGICAL METHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its furthest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so): that is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadaysâit follows &quot;from its definition,&quot; as mathematicians say. The question is ultimately whether we really recognize the will as OPERATING, whether we believe in the causality of the will; if we do soâand fundamentally our belief IN THIS is just our belief in causality itselfâwe MUST make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality. &quot;Will&quot; can naturally only operate on &quot;will&quot;âand not on &quot;matter&quot; (not on &quot;nerves,&quot; for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be hazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever &quot;effects&quot; are recognizedâand whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power operates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will. Granted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of willânamely, the Will to Power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all organic functions could be traced back to this Will to Power, and that the solution of the problem of generation and nutritionâit is one problemâcould also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the right to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER.

Happiness and virtue are no arguments. It is willingly forgotten, however, even on the part of thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as little counter-arguments. A thing could be TRUE, although it were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge of itâso that the strength of a mind might be measured by the amount of &quot;truth&quot; it could endureâor to speak more plainly, by the extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped, and falsified. But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the wicked who are happyâa species about whom moralists are silent. Perhaps severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of strong, independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle, refined, yielding good-nature, and habit of taking things easily, which are prized, and rightly prized in a learned man.

Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the CONTRARY only be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in? A question worth asking!âit would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his recollection. Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret: shame is inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a maskâthere is so much goodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something costly and fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shame requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach, and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes, and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature, which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his friends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him thereâand that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; nay, more, around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is to say, SUPERFICIAL interpretation of every word he utters, every step he takes, every sign of life he manifests.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000076\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000076\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>41.

Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free, VERY free spirits, these philosophers of the futureâas certainly also they will not be merely free spirits, but something more, higher, greater, and fundamentally different, which does not wish to be misunderstood and mistaken? But while I say this, I feel under OBLIGATION almost as much to them as to ourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and forerunners), to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the conception of &quot;free spirit&quot; obscure. In every country of Europe, and the same in America, there is at present something which makes an abuse of this name a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of spirits, who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts promptânot to mention that in respect to the NEW philosophers who are appearing, they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors. Briefly and regrettably, they belong to the LEVELLERS, these wrongly named &quot;free spirits&quot;âas glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of the democratic taste and its &quot;modern ideas&quot; all of them men without solitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only, they are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in their innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existedâa notion which happily inverts the truth entirely! What they would fain attain with all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow happiness of the herd, together with security, safety, comfort, and alleviation of life for every one, their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called &quot;Equality of Rights&quot; and &quot;Sympathy with All Sufferers&quot;âand suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be DONE AWAY WITH. We opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and conscience to the question how and where the plant &quot;man&quot; has hitherto grown most vigorously, believe that this has always taken place under the opposite conditions, that for this end the dangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously, his inventive faculty and dissembling power (his &quot;spirit&quot;) had to develop into subtlety and daring under long oppression and compulsion, and his Will to Life had to be increased to the unconditioned Will to Powerâwe believe that severity, violence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy, stoicism, tempter's art and devilry of every kind,âthat everything wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and serpentine in man, serves as well for the elevation of the human species as its oppositeâwe do not even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH, and in any case we find ourselves here, both with our speech and our silence, at the OTHER extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability, as their antipodes perhaps? What wonder that we &quot;free spirits&quot; are not exactly the most communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in every respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE perhaps it will then be driven? And as to the import of the dangerous formula, &quot;Beyond Good and Evil,&quot; with which we at least avoid confusion, we ARE something else than &quot;libres-penseurs,&quot; &quot;liben pensatori&quot; &quot;free-thinkers,&quot; and whatever these honest advocates of &quot;modern ideas&quot; like to call themselves.

The human soul and its limits, the range of man's inner experiences hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances of these experiences, the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME, and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordained hunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a &quot;big hunt&quot;. But how often must he say despairingly to himself: &quot;A single individual! alas, only a single individual! and this great forest, this virgin forest!&quot; So he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants, and fine trained hounds, that he could send into the history of the human soul, to drive HIS game together. In vain: again and again he experiences, profoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his curiosity. The evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous hunting-domains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense are required, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the &quot;BIG hunt,&quot; and also the great danger commences,âit is precisely then that they lose their keen eye and nose. In order, for instance, to divine and determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi, a person would perhaps himself have to possess as profound, as bruised, as immense an experience as the intellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he would still require that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality, which, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and effectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences.âBut who could do me this service!

Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not infrequently achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited world, which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind it and in it, counting besides the education in tolerance which the Imperium Romanum gaveâthis faith is NOT that sincere, austere slave-faith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell, or some other northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and Christianity, it is much rather the faith of Pascal, which resembles in a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reasonâa tough, long-lived, worm-like reason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow. The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation. There is cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith, which is adapted to a tender, many-sided, and very fastidious conscience, it takes for granted that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL, that all the past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in the form of which &quot;faith&quot; comes to it. Modern men, with their obtuseness as regards all Christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense for the terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by the paradox of the formula, &quot;God on the Cross&quot;. Hitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in inversion, nor anything at once so dreadful, questioning, and questionable as this formula: it promised a transvaluation of all ancient valuesâIt was the Orient, the PROFOUND Orient, it was the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and its noble, light-minded toleration, on the Roman &quot;Catholicism&quot; of non-faith, and it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith, the half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith, which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against them. &quot;Enlightenment&quot; causes revolt, for the slave desires the unconditioned, he understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in morals, he loves as he hates, without NUANCE, to the very depths, to the point of pain, to the point of sicknessâhis many HIDDEN sufferings make him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering.

Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far, we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen: solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinenceâbut without its being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect, or IF any relation at all of cause and effect exists there. This latter doubt is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality, which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even to philosophersâperhaps it is time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or, better still, to look AWAY, TO GO AWAYâYet in the background of the most recent philosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the problem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how is the saint possible?âthat seems to have been the very question with which Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. And thus it was a genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adherent (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is concerned), namely, Richard Wagner, should bring his own life-work to an end just here, and should finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as Kundry, type vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the mad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosisâor as I call it, &quot;the religious mood&quot;âmade its latest epidemical outbreak and display as the &quot;Salvation Army&quot;âIf it be a question, however, as to what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages, and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous thereinânamely, the immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, of states of the soul regarded as morally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident that a &quot;bad man&quot; was all at once turned into a &quot;saint,&quot; a good man. The hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the dominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions of moral values, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions into the text and facts of the case?

There is an Oriental exaltation of the mind in it, like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as in the case of St. Augustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive manner, all nobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl's or youth's puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid, also as her last ambition.

What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartesâand indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedureâan ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject and predicate conceptionâthat is to say, an ATTENTAT on the fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophy, as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN, although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious. Formerly, in effect, one believed in &quot;the soul&quot; as one believed in grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, &quot;I&quot; is the condition, &quot;think&quot; is the predicate and is conditionedâto think is an activity for which one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made, with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out of this net,âto see if the opposite was not perhaps true: &quot;think&quot; the condition, and &quot;I&quot; the conditioned; &quot;I,&quot; therefore, only a synthesis which has been MADE by thinking itself. KANT really wished to prove that, starting from the subject, the subject could not be provedânor the object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the subject, and therefore of &quot;the soul,&quot; may not always have been strange to him,âthe thought which once had an immense power on earth as the Vedanta philosophy.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000094\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000094\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>55. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but three of these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificed human beings to their God, and perhaps just those they loved the bestâto this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive religions, and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri, that most terrible of all Roman anachronisms. Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed to their God the strongest instincts they possessed, their &quot;nature&quot;; THIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and &quot;anti-natural&quot; fanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed? Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness and justice? Was it not necessary to sacrifice God himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate, nothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingnessâthis paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the rising generation; we all know something thereof already.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000095\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000095\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>56.

Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft placidity called &quot;prayer,&quot; the state of perpetual readiness for the &quot;coming of God&quot;), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is DISHONOURINGâthat it vulgarizes body and soulâis not quite unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy, time-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for &quot;unbelief&quot; more than anything else? Among these, for instance, who are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I find &quot;free-thinkers&quot; of diversified species and origin, but above all a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel themselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the &quot;Fatherland,&quot; and the newspapers, and their &quot;family duties&quot;; it seems that they have no time whatever left for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasureâfor it is impossible, they say to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs; should certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require their participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many things are doneâwith a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without much curiosity or discomfort;âthey live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters. Among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of German Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part of pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole profession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to which he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the &quot;uncleanliness&quot; of spirit which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the Church. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety; perhaps even the contrary. The practical indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which shuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.âEvery age has its own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages may envy it: and how much naiveteâadorable, childlike, and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and ABOVE which he himself has developedâhe, the little arrogant dwarf and mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of &quot;ideas,&quot; of &quot;modern ideas&quot;!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000098\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000098\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>59.

Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to FALSIFY its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which they wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and deified,âone might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as their HIGHEST rank. It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become strong enough, hard enough, artist enough.... Piety, the &quot;Life in God,&quot; regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration and artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at any price.

The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand himâas the man of the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general development of mankind,âwill use religion for his disciplining and educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political and economic conditions. The selecting and disciplining influenceâdestructive, as well as creative and fashioningâwhich can be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the sort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who are strong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authorityâas a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common, betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter, their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. And in the case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government (over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing GROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE filth of all political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood this fact. With the help of a religious organization, they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher and super-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which, through fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight in self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers sufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and of solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally, to ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy, with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner, almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to liveâthis very difficulty being necessary.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000101\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000101\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>62. To be sureâto make also the bad counter-reckoning against such religions, and to bring to light their secret dangersâthe cost is always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end, and not a means along with other means. Among men, as among all other animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating, infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases, among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare exception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents, the greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of men, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult to determine. What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle; they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as false and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied, and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religionsâto give a general appreciation of themâare among the principal causes which have kept the type of &quot;man&quot; upon a lower levelâthey have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE PERISHED. One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the &quot;spiritual men&quot; of Christianity have done for Europe hitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless, and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they to do in order to work systematically in that fashion, and with a good conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which means, in deed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE EUROPEAN RACE? To REVERSE all estimates of valueâTHAT is what they had to do! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous, manly, conquering, and imperiousâall instincts which are natural to the highest and most successful type of &quot;man&quot;âinto uncertainty, distress of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and earthly thingsâTHAT is the task the Church imposed on itself, and was obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value, &quot;unworldliness,&quot; &quot;unsensuousness,&quot; and &quot;higher man&quot; fused into one sentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and impartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never cease marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIME ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer Epicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach this almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in the European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: &quot;Oh, you bunglers, presumptuous pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a work for your hands? How you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you presumed to do!&quot;âI should say that Christianity has hitherto been the most portentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough, to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men, not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from man:âSUCH men, with their &quot;equality before God,&quot; have hitherto swayed the destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly, mediocre, the European of the present day.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000102\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000102\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000103\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000103\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c2\\\"><br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000104\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000104\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><h2>CHAPTER IV.

The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle, belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the &quot;Science of Morals&quot; belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:âan interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist. Indeed, the expression, &quot;Science of Morals&quot; is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,âwhich is always a foretaste of more modest expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT is still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth, and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perishâand perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living crystallizationsâas preparation for a THEORY OF TYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest. All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness, demanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science: they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to moralityâand every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has been regarded as something &quot;given.&quot; How far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problemâleft in dust and decayâof a description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing to moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgementâperhaps as the morality of their environment, their position, their church, their Zeitgeist, their climate and zoneâit was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the real problems of moralsâproblems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every &quot;Science of Morals&quot; hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there! That which philosophers called &quot;giving a basis to morality,&quot; and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light, proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in questionâand in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and vivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what innocenceâalmost worthy of honourâSchopenhauer represents his own task, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a &quot;Science&quot; whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old wives: &quot;The principle,&quot; he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality, translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] &quot;the axiom about the purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juvaâis REALLY the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish, ... the REAL basis of ethics which has been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries.&quot;âThe difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be greatâit is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist, ACTUALLYâplayed the flute... daily after dinner: one may read about the matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at moralityâwho assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what? Is that reallyâa pessimist?</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000234\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000234\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>187. Apart from the value of such assertions as &quot;there is a categorical imperative in us,&quot; one can always ask: What does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied; with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others he wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,âthis system of morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant especially, gives us to understand by his morals that &quot;what is estimable in me, is that I know how to obeyâand with you it SHALL not be otherwise than with me!&quot; In short, systems of morals are only a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000235\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000235\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of tyranny against &quot;nature&quot; and also against &quot;reason&quot;, that is, however, no objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is essential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a long constraint. In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal, or Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength and freedomâthe metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves!ânot excepting some of the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousnessâ&quot;for the sake of a folly,&quot; as utilitarian bunglers say, and thereby deem themselves wiseâ&quot;from submission to arbitrary laws,&quot; as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves &quot;free,&quot; even free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however, that everything of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself, or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely this is &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;âand not laisser-aller! Every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his &quot;most natural&quot; condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing, and constructing in the moments of &quot;inspiration&quot;âand how strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold, and ambiguous in it). The essential thing &quot;in heaven and in earth&quot; is, apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance, virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spiritualityâanything whatever that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable to Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:âall this violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness, has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has attained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility; granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere, &quot;nature&quot; shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT magnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). That for centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove somethingânowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker who &quot;wishes to prove something&quot;âthat it was always settled beforehand what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps in the Asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent, Christian-moral explanation of immediate personal events &quot;for the glory of God,&quot; or &quot;for the good of the soul&quot;:âthis tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and the finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline. One may look at every system of morals in this light: it is &quot;nature&quot; therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller, the too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for immediate dutiesâit teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in a certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development. &quot;Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come to grief, and lose all respect for thyself&quot;âthis seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither &quot;categorical,&quot; as old Kant wished (consequently the &quot;otherwise&quot;), nor does it address itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the animal &quot;man&quot; generally, to MANKIND.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000236\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000236\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his weekâand work-day again:âas a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although, as is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect to work). Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful influences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary days are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to hunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism, seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during which an impulse learns to humble and submit itselfâat the same time also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise admit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst of Hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with Aphrodisiacal odours).âHere also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period of European history, and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments, that the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000237\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000237\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was too noble. &quot;No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done unwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do so, however, if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily make himâgood.&quot;âThis mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that &quot;it is STUPID to do wrong&quot;; while they accept &quot;good&quot; as identical with &quot;useful and pleasant,&quot; without further thought. As regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.âPlato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into themâhe, the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible modificationsânamely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities.

The old theological problem of &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Knowledge,&quot; or more plainly, of instinct and reasonâthe question whether, in respect to the valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality, which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to a &quot;Why,&quot; that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utilityâit is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of Socrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity. Socrates himself, following, of course, the taste of his talentâthat of a surpassing dialecticianâtook first the side of reason; and, in fact, what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions? In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also at himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity. &quot;But why&quot;âhe said to himselfâ&quot;should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts! One must set them right, and the reason ALSOâone must follow the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments.&quot; This was the real FALSENESS of that great and mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment.âPlato, more innocent in such matters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to himself, at the expenditure of all his strengthâthe greatest strength a philosopher had ever expendedâthat reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to &quot;God&quot;; and since Plato, all theologians and philosophers have followed the same pathâwhich means that in matters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it, &quot;Faith,&quot; or as I call it, &quot;the herd&quot;) has hitherto triumphed. Unless one should make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution), who recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and Descartes was superficial.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000239\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000239\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest processes of all &quot;knowledge and cognizance&quot;: there, as here, the premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to &quot;belief,&quot; and the lack of distrust and patience are first developedâour senses learn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more force, more &quot;morality.&quot; It is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hear another language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words with which we are more familiar and conversantâit was thus, for example, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse to the new; and generally, even in the &quot;simplest&quot; processes of sensation, the emotions DOMINATEâsuch as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion of indolence.âAs little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words (not to speak of syllables) of a pageâhe rather takes about five out of every twenty words at random, and &quot;guesses&quot; the probably appropriate sense to themâjust as little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the most remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the greater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate any event, EXCEPT as &quot;inventors&quot; thereof.

The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the difference of their lists of desirable thingsâin their regarding different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to the greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized desirable things:âit manifests itself much more in what they regard as actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a woman, for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession, sees the &quot;questionableness,&quot; the mere apparentness of such ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to haveâonly THEN does he look upon her as &quot;possessed.&quot; A third, however, has not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. One man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more refined thirst for possession, says to himself: &quot;One may not deceive where one desires to possess&quot;âhe is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: &quot;I must, therefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!&quot; Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as though, for instance, he should &quot;merit&quot; help, seek just THEIR help, and would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help. With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their childrenâthey call that &quot;education&quot;; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born (as among the ancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession.

Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples, states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who commandâin view, therefore, of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto, one may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is now innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives the command &quot;Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally refrain from something&quot;, in short, &quot;Thou shalt&quot;. This need tries to satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its strength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all sorts of commandersâparents, teachers, laws, class prejudices, or public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human development, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and turning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of obedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of things actually exists in Europe at presentâI call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class. They know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of the law, or of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd, as &quot;first servants of their people,&quot; or &quot;instruments of the public weal&quot;. On the other hand, the gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however, where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative constitutions, for example, are of this origin. In spite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeansâof this fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proof the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000247\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000247\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his bodyâthat is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom at peaceâsuch a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an average, be a weak man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is IN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean or Christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unityâit is the &quot;Sabbath of Sabbaths,&quot; to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine, who was himself such a man.âShould, however, the contrariety and conflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus to lifeâand if, on the other hand, in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of self-control and self-deception), there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men, predestined for conquering and circumventing others, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades and Caesar (with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second), and among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear precisely in the same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for repose, comes to the front; the two types are complementary to each other, and spring from the same causes.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000248\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000248\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be no &quot;morality of love to one's neighbour.&quot; Granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness, gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names as &quot;virtues,&quot; and eventually almost coincide with the conception &quot;morality&quot;: in that period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral valuationsâthey are still ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should it be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES PUBLICA. After all, &quot;love to our neighbour&quot; is always a secondary matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utilityâunder other names, of course, than those here givenâbut had to be fostered and cultivated (because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strongâwhen the outlets for them are lackingâand are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowmentâthat is now the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, &quot;the lamb,&quot; and still more &quot;the sheep,&quot; wins respect. There is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL, and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it to be somehow unfairâit is certain that the idea of &quot;punishment&quot; and &quot;the obligation to punish&quot; are then painful and alarming to people. &quot;Is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!&quot;âwith these questions gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear, one would have done away with this morality at the same time, it would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer necessary!âWhoever examines the conscience of the present-day European, will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd &quot;we wish that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!&quot; Some time or otherâthe will and the way THERETO is nowadays called &quot;progress&quot; all over Europe.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000249\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000249\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times, for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truthsâOUR truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will be accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to men of &quot;modern ideas&quot; that we have constantly applied the terms &quot;herd,&quot; &quot;herd-instincts,&quot; and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We have found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teachâthey &quot;know&quot; today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which here thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts, according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the matter, only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after which many other moralities, and above all HIGHER moralities, are or should be possible. Against such a &quot;possibility,&quot; against such a &quot;should be,&quot; however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and inexorably &quot;I am morality itself and nothing else is morality!&quot; Indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement. That its TEMPO, however, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for those who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated by the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised teeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the highways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call themselves Socialists and want a &quot;free society,&quot; those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of repudiating the notions &quot;master&quot; and &quot;servant&quot;âni dieu ni maitre, says a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs &quot;rights&quot; any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of all former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy, in their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the very animals, up even to &quot;God&quot;âthe extravagance of &quot;sympathy for God&quot; belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering generally, in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or ALLOWING it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening, under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new Buddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as though it were morality in itself, the climax, the ATTAINED climax of mankind, the sole hope of the future, the consolation of the present, the great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether at one in their belief in the community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and therefore in &quot;themselves.&quot;</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000250\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000250\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>203.

The conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such responsibility; and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the dreadful danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:âthese are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits! these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of &quot;man&quot; himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future of mankindâa game in which neither the hand, nor even a &quot;finger of God&quot; has participated!âhe who divines the fate that is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; and still more under the whole of Christo-European moralityâsuffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared. He sees at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and arrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and how often in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions and new paths:âhe knows still better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become contemptible. The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of the &quot;man of the future&quot;âas idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow-patesâthis degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal (or as they call it, to a man of &quot;free society&quot;), this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of mankindâand perhaps also a new MISSION!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000251\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000251\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000252\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000252\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c2\\\"><br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000253\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000253\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><h2>CHAPTER VI.

At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that which it has always beenânamely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES, according to BalzacâI would venture to protest against an improper and injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations of science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right out of one's own EXPERIENCEâexperience, as it seems to me, always implies unfortunate experience?âto treat of such an important question of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST science like women and artists (&quot;Ah! this dreadful science!&quot; sigh their instinct and their shame, &quot;it always FINDS THINGS OUT!&quot;). The declaration of independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy, is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtimeâwhich does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet. Here also the instinct of the populace cries, &quot;Freedom from all masters!&quot; and after science has, with the happiest results, resisted theology, whose &quot;hand-maid&quot; it had been too long, it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy, and in its turn to play the &quot;master&quot;âwhat am I saying! to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memoryâthe memory of a scientific man, if you please!âteems with the naivetes of insolence which I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters, who are both the one and the other by profession). On one occasion it was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which &quot;does nobody any good&quot;. At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another time the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily extended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most frequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars, the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid ofâthe result being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to me, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection with German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive, and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and origin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down belowâin Germany, for instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves &quot;realists,&quot; or &quot;positivists,&quot; which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists, that is very evident! All of them are persons who have been vanquished and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science, who at one time or another claimed more from themselves, without having a right to the &quot;more&quot; and its responsibilityâand who now, creditably, rancorously, and vindictively, represent in word and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task and supremacy of philosophy After all, how could it be otherwise? Science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern philosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to a &quot;theory of knowledge,&quot; no more in fact than a diffident science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right to enterâthat is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony, something that awakens pity. How could such a philosophyâRULE!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000255\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000255\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and &quot;specialize&quot; so that he will no longer attain to his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and spiritual rat-catcherâin short, a misleader. This is in the last instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of conscience. To double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of lifeâhe learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-intoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives &quot;wisely,&quot; or &quot;as a philosopher,&quot; it hardly means anything more than &quot;prudently and apart.&quot; Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a bad game; but the GENUINE philosopherâdoes it not seem so to US, my friends?âlives &quot;unphilosophically&quot; and &quot;unwisely,&quot; above all, IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts and temptations of lifeâhe risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS bad game.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000256\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000256\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either ENGENDERS or PRODUCESâboth words understood in their fullest senseâthe man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of the old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two principal functions of man. To both, of course, to the scholar and to the old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of indemnificationâin these cases one emphasizes the respectabilityâand yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture of vexation. Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man? Firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is to say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file, equability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the instinct for people like himself, and for that which they requireâfor instance: the portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration (which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again to be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go, but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and more reservedâhis eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy. The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of mediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man, and endeavours to breakâor still better, to relaxâevery bent bow To relax, of course, with consideration, and naturally with an indulgent handâto RELAX with confiding sympathy that is the real art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to introduce itself as the religion of sympathy.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000257\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000257\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spiritâand who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded IPSISIMOSITY!âin the end, however, one must learn caution even with regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation and glorificationâas is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest honours to &quot;disinterested knowledge&quot; The objective man, who no longer curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful He is only an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRRORâhe is no &quot;purpose in himself&quot; The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such desires only as knowing or &quot;reflecting&quot; impliesâhe waits until something comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that even the light footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film Whatever &quot;personality&quot; he still possesses seems to him accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms and events He calls up the recollection of &quot;himself&quot; with an effort, and not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other persons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health, or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack of companions and societyâindeed, he sets himself to reflect on his suffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how to help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which he has to atone for these virtues of his!âand as man generally, he becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one wish love or hatred from himâI mean love and hatred as God, woman, and animal understand themâhe will do what he can, and furnish what he can. But one must not be surprised if it should not be muchâif he should show himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and deteriorated. His love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and rather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He is only genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality is he still &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;natural.&quot; His mirroring and eternally self-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to deny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. &quot;JE NE MEPRISE PRESQUE RIEN&quot;âhe says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue the PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of any one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. If he has been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with the Caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what is more essential in him has been overlookedâhe is an instrument, something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but nothing in himselfâPRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrument, a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected; but he is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man in whom the REST of existence justifies itself, no terminationâand still less a commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing hardy, powerful, self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a soft, inflated, delicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some kind of content and frame to &quot;shape&quot; itself theretoâfor the most part a man without frame and content, a &quot;selfless&quot; man. Consequently, also, nothing for women, IN PARENTHESI.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000258\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000258\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skepticâI hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the objective spirit?âpeople all hear it impatiently; they regard him on that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many, many questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so many, he is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of skepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian NIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means denial, butâdreadful thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind of &quot;good-will&quot;âa will to the veritable, actual negation of lifeâthere is, as is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative than skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism; and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an antidote to the &quot;spirit,&quot; and its underground noises. &quot;Are not our ears already full of bad sounds?&quot; say the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and almost as a kind of safety police; &quot;this subterranean Nay is terrible! Be still, ye pessimistic moles!&quot; The skeptic, in effect, that delicate creature, is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled so as to start at every Nay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels something like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!âthey seem to him opposed to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with Montaigne: &quot;What do I know?&quot; Or with Socrates: &quot;I know that I know nothing.&quot; Or: &quot;Here I do not trust myself, no door is open to me.&quot; Or: &quot;Even if the door were open, why should I enter immediately?&quot; Or: &quot;What is the use of any hasty hypotheses? It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses at all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked? to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not time enough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons, can ye not at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx, too, is a Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher.&quot;âThus does a skeptic console himself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In the new generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast, and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That, however, which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the WILL; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or the courageous feeling of pleasure in willingâthey are doubtful of the &quot;freedom of the will&quot; even in their dreams Our present-day Europe, the scene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes, and CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its heights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signsâand often sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will, where do we not find this cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes' How seductively ornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises for this disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself nowadays in the show-cases as &quot;objectiveness,&quot; &quot;the scientific spirit,&quot; &quot;L'ART POUR L'ART,&quot; and &quot;pure voluntary knowledge,&quot; is only decked-out skepticism and paralysis of willâI am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the European diseaseâThe disease of the will is diffused unequally over Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest prevailed, it decreases according as &quot;the barbarian&quot; stillâor againâasserts his claims under the loose drapery of Western culture It is therefore in the France of today, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm, and France, which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive, now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe, by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The power to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of Germany it is stronger than in Central Germany, it is considerably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latterânot to mention Italy, which is too young yet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can exercise will, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where Europe as it were flows back to Asiaânamely, in Russia There the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated, there the willâuncertain whether to be negative or affirmativeâwaits threateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists) Perhaps not only Indian wars and complications in Asia would be necessary to free Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal subversion, the shattering of the empire into small states, and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not say this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather prefer the contraryâI mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threateningânamely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-statism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close.

As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily merely by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already understand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers (who, as King of Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical geniusâand therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged type of German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great, had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what was then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social formâhis ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son was not man enough. There, however, he deceived himself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place? He saw his son lapsed to atheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of clever Frenchmenâhe saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the spider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no longer commands, is no longer ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous skepticismâwho knows TO WHAT EXTENT it was encouraged just by his father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to solitude?âthe skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into Germany in the person of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does not believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart. It is the GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued Fredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a considerable time under the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historical distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great German philologists and historical critics (who, rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction and dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually established itselfâin spite of all Romanticism in music and philosophyâin which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it when warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet calls it, not without a shudder. But if one would realize how characteristic is this fear of the &quot;man&quot; in the German spirit which awakened Europe out of its &quot;dogmatic slumber,&quot; let us call to mind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new oneâand that it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of Europe as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools. Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough Napoleon's astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for centuries as the &quot;German spirit&quot; &quot;VOILA UN HOMME!&quot;âthat was as much as to say &quot;But this is a MAN! And I only expected to see a German!&quot;</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000260\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000260\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>210. Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be designated therebyâand not they themselves. With equal right they might call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments. By the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense? In their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic century can approve of?âThere is no doubt these coming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method, the wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for self-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds They will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only) than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the &quot;truth&quot; in order that it may &quot;please&quot; them, or &quot;elevate&quot; and &quot;inspire&quot; themâthey will rather have little faith in &quot;TRUTH&quot; bringing with it such revels for the feelings. They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one says in their presence &quot;That thought elevates me, why should it not be true?&quot; or &quot;That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?&quot; or &quot;That artist enlarges me, why should he not be great?&quot; Perhaps they will not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile &quot;Christian sentiments&quot; with &quot;antique taste,&quot; or even with &quot;modern parliamentarism&quot; (the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory century). Critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future, they may even make a display thereof as their special adornmentânevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that account. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that &quot;philosophy itself is criticism and critical scienceâand nothing else whatever!&quot; Though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste of KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are far from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman of Konigsberg was only a great critic.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000261\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000261\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with philosophersâthat precisely here one should strictly give &quot;each his own,&quot; and not give those far too much, these far too little. It may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and MUST remain standing he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist, and historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and riddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and &quot;free spirit,&quot; and almost everything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values and estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up to any height, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something elseâit requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers, after the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize some great existing body of valuationsâthat is to say, former DETERMINATIONS OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for a time called &quot;truths&quot;âwhether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the POLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous, conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long, even &quot;time&quot; itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense and wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined pride, all tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: &quot;Thus SHALL it be!&quot; They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all subjugators of the pastâthey grasp at the future with a creative hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an instrument, and a hammer. Their &quot;knowing&quot; is CREATING, their creating is a law-giving, their will to truth isâWILL TO POWER.âAre there at present such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers?

It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever found himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his day. Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls philosophersâwho rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom, but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogatorsâhave found their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end, however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of their age. In putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been for the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to his aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how much virtue was OUTLIVED, they have always said &quot;We must remove hence to where YOU are least at home&quot; In the face of a world of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; which would like to confine every one in a corner, in a &quot;specialty,&quot; a philosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled to place the greatness of man, the conception of &quot;greatness,&quot; precisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in the ideal of the philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity for prolonged resolution, must specially be included in the conception of &quot;greatness&quot;, with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its ideal of a silly, renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to an opposite ageâsuch as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its accumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of worn-out instincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves goâ&quot;for the sake of happiness,&quot; as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their conduct indicatedâand who had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led, IRONY was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh, as into the flesh and heart of the &quot;noble,&quot; with a look that said plainly enough &quot;Do not dissemble before me! hereâwe are equal!&quot; At present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-animal alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when &quot;equality of right&quot; can too readily be transformed into equality in wrongâI mean to say into general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged, against the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher responsibility, the creative plenipotence and lordlinessâat present it belongs to the conception of &quot;greatness&quot; to be noble, to wish to be apart, to be capable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live by personal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts &quot;He shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will; precisely this shall be called GREATNESS: as diversified as can be entire, as ample as can be full.&quot; And to ask once more the question: Is greatness POSSIBLEânowadays?</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000263\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000263\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be taught: one must &quot;know&quot; it by experienceâor one should have the pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things of which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters:âthe very few know them, are permitted to know them, and all popular ideas about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their presence, it is incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as troublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as &quot;worthy of the SWEAT of the noble&quot;âbut not at all as something easy and divine, closely related to dancing and exuberance! &quot;To think&quot; and to take a matter &quot;seriously,&quot; &quot;arduously&quot;âthat is one and the same thing to them; such only has been their &quot;experience.&quot;âArtists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything &quot;arbitrarily,&quot; and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climaxâin short, that necessity and &quot;freedom of will&quot; are then the same thing with them. There is, in fine, a gradation of rank in psychical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality. Of what use is it for nimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists to press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as it were into this &quot;holy of holies&quot;âas so often happens nowadays! But coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in the primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intruders, though they may dash and break their heads thereon. People have always to be born to a high station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED for it: a person has only a right to philosophyâtaking the word in its higher significanceâin virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the &quot;blood,&quot; decide here also. Many generations must have prepared the way for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the bold, easy, delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all the readiness for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance and contemning look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely loves....</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000264\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000264\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p><a></a></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000265\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000265\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"c2\\\"><br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000266\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000266\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><h2>CHAPTER VII.

And is there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own virtues? Is it not almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues? But this &quot;believing in one's own virtues&quot;âis it not practically the same as what was formerly called one's &quot;good conscience,&quot; that long, respectable pigtail of an idea, which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough also behind their understandings?

As this is growing wearisome, I would now recommend for a change something else for a pleasureânamely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat, honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the middle-class in its best momentsâsubtler even than the understanding of its victims:âa repeated proof that &quot;instinct&quot; is the most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered. In short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the &quot;rule&quot; in its struggle with the &quot;exception&quot;: there you have a spectacle fit for Gods and godlike malignity! Or, in plainer words, practise vivisection on &quot;good people,&quot; on the &quot;homo bonae voluntatis,&quot; ON YOURSELVES!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000272\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000272\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>219. The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature, and finally, it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING subtleâmalice spiritualises. They are glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed with intellectual goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for the &quot;equality of all before God,&quot; and almost NEED the belief in God for this purpose. It is among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found. If any one were to say to them &quot;A lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral man&quot;âit would make them furious, I shall take care not to say so. I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities, that it is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the &quot;merely moral&quot; man, after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice, perhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty spirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the world, even among thingsâand not only among men.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000273\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000273\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>220. Now that the praise of the &quot;disinterested person&quot; is so popular one mustâprobably not without some dangerâget an idea of WHAT people actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary menâincluding the cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if appearances do not deceive. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more refined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely &quot;uninteresting&quot; to the average manâif, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these interests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to act &quot;disinterestedly.&quot; There have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment a seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression (perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience?), instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that &quot;disinterested&quot; action is very interesting and &quot;interested&quot; action, provided that... &quot;And love?&quot;âWhat! Even an action for love's sake shall be &quot;unegoistic&quot;?

In short, the question is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER is. For instance, in a person created and destined for command, self-denial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be the waste of virtues: so it seems to me. Every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins against good taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL seduction under the mask of philanthropyâand precisely a seduction and injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men. Moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF RANK; their presumption must be driven home to their conscienceâuntil they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that 'what is right for one is proper for another.'&quot;âSo said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme.

The hybrid Europeanâa tolerably ugly plebeian, taken all in allâabsolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroom of costumes. To be sure, he notices that none of the costumes fit him properlyâhe changes and changes. Let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style, and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account of &quot;nothing suiting&quot; us. It is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic, or classical, or Christian, or Florentine, or barocco, or &quot;national,&quot; in moribus et artibus: it does not &quot;clothe us&quot;! But the &quot;spirit,&quot; especially the &quot;historical spirit,&quot; profits even by this desperation: once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested, put on, taken off, packed up, and above all studiedâwe are the first studious age in puncto of &quot;costumes,&quot; I mean as concerns morals, articles of belief, artistic tastes, and religions; we are prepared as no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style, for the most spiritual festivalâlaughter and arrogance, for the transcendental height of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhaps we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here, the domain where even we can still be original, probably as parodists of the world's history and as God's Merry-Andrews,âperhaps, though nothing else of the present have a future, our laughter itself may have a future!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000277\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000277\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>224. The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people, a community, or an individual has lived, the &quot;divining instinct&quot; for the relationships of these valuations, for the relation of the authority of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces),âthis historical sense, which we Europeans claim as our specialty, has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into which Europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and racesâit is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this faculty as its sixth sense. Owing to this mingling, the past of every form and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one another, flows forth into us &quot;modern souls&quot;; our instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are a kind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives its advantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desire, we have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age never had; we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations, and to every form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; and in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto has just been semi-barbarity, the &quot;historical sense&quot; implies almost the sense and instinct for everything, the taste and tongue for everything: whereby it immediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. For instance, we enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer, whom men of distinguished culture (as the French of the seventeenth century, like Saint-Evremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and even Voltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so easily appropriateâwhom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. The very decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their promptly ready disgust, their hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange, their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the averseness of every distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire, a dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what is strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards the best things of the world which are not their property or could not become their preyâand no faculty is more unintelligible to such men than just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian curiosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian of the circle of AEschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter or irritation: but weâaccept precisely this wild motleyness, this medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial, with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement of art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English populace in which Shakespeare's art and taste lives, as perhaps on the Chiaja of Naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way, enchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of the lower quarters of the town. That as men of the &quot;historical sense&quot; we have our virtues, is not to be disputed:âwe are unpretentious, unselfish, modest, brave, habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very grateful, very patient, very complaisantâbut with all this we are perhaps not very &quot;tasteful.&quot; Let us finally confess it, that what is most difficult for us men of the &quot;historical sense&quot; to grasp, feel, taste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art, the essentially noble in works and men, their moment of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected themselves. Perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste, at least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly, hesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and there: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite,âwhen a super-abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying, by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us, let us confess it to ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite, the immeasurable.

In man CREATURE and CREATOR are united: in man there is not only matter, shred, excess, clay, mire, folly, chaos; but there is also the creator, the sculptor, the hardness of the hammer, the divinity of the spectator, and the seventh dayâdo ye understand this contrast? And that YOUR sympathy for the &quot;creature in man&quot; applies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged, stretched, roasted, annealed, refinedâto that which must necessarily SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer?

I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific appliancesâand that &quot;virtue,&quot; in my opinion, has been MORE injured by the TEDIOUSNESS of its advocates than by anything else; at the same time, however, I would not wish to overlook their general usefulness. It is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals, and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day become interesting! But let us not be afraid! Things still remain today as they have always been: I see no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES) an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be conducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring mannerâthat CALAMITY might be involved therein. Observe, for example, the indefatigable, inevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they stalk on, stalk along (a Homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the footsteps of Bentham, just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of the respectable Helvetius! (no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius, CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE, to use an expression of Galiani). No new thought, nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression of an old thought, not even a proper history of what has been previously thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature, taking it all in all, unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. In effect, the old English vice called CANT, which is MORAL TARTUFFISM, has insinuated itself also into these moralists (whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one MUST read them), concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a race of former Puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific tinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan? That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem? Is moralizing not-immoral?) In the end, they all want English morality to be recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the &quot;general utility,&quot; or &quot;the happiness of the greatest number,&quot;âno! the happiness of ENGLAND, will be best served thereby. They would like, by all means, to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness, I mean after COMFORT and FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in Parliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has just consisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous, conscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the &quot;general welfare&quot; is no ideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a nostrum,âthat what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another, that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to higher men, in short, that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man and man, and consequently between morality and morality. They are an unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian Englishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one cannot think highly enough of their utility.

In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity, there still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the fear, of the &quot;cruel wild beast,&quot; the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of these humaner agesâthat even obvious truths, as if by the agreement of centuries, have long remained unuttered, because they have the appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again. I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape; let others capture it again and give it so much &quot;milk of pious sentiment&quot; [FOOTNOTE: An expression from Schiller's William Tell, Act IV, Scene 3.] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old corner.âOne ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open one's eyes; one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that such immodest gross errorsâas, for instance, have been fostered by ancient and modern philosophers with regard to tragedyâmay no longer wander about virtuously and boldly. Almost everything that we call &quot;higher culture&quot; is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTYâthis is my thesis; the &quot;wild beast&quot; has not been slain at all, it lives, it flourishes, it has only beenâtransfigured. That which constitutes the painful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in so-called tragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime, up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. What the Roman enjoys in the arena, the Christian in the ecstasies of the cross, the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake, or of the bull-fight, the present-day Japanese who presses his way to the tragedy, the workman of the Parisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions, the Wagnerienne who, with unhinged will, &quot;undergoes&quot; the performance of &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;âwhat all these enjoy, and strive with mysterious ardour to drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe &quot;cruelty.&quot; Here, to be sure, we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times, which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is an abundant, super-abundant enjoyment even in one's own suffering, in causing one's own sufferingâand wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation, as among the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to desensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal-like SACRIFIZIA DELL' INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and impelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS HIMSELF.âFinally, let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he compels his spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often enough against the wishes of his heart:âhe forces it to say Nay, where he would like to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit, which instinctively aims at appearance and superficiality,âeven in every desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000284\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000284\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>230. Perhaps what I have said here about a &quot;fundamental will of the spirit&quot; may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed a word of explanation.âThat imperious something which is popularly called &quot;the spirit,&quot; wishes to be master internally and externally, and to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will. Its requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. The power of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it arbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of the &quot;outside world.&quot; Its object thereby is the incorporation of new &quot;experiences,&quot; the assortment of new things in the old arrangementsâin short, growth; or more properly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of increased powerâis its object. This same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner denial of this or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive attitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity, with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance: as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power, its &quot;digestive power,&quot; to speak figuratively (and in fact &quot;the spirit&quot; resembles a stomach more than anything else). Here also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived (perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so, but is only allowed to pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity, an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness and mystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified, the diminished, the misshapen, the beautifiedâan enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally, in this connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before themâthe constant pressing and straining of a creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys also its feeling of security thereinâit is precisely by its Protean arts that it is best protected and concealed!âCOUNTER TO this propensity for appearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a cloak, in short, for an outsideâfor every outside is a cloakâthere operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and INSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste, which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought to be, that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for introspection, and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe words. He will say: &quot;There is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit&quot;: let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so! In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps our &quot;extravagant honesty&quot; were talked about, whispered about, and glorifiedâwe free, VERY free spiritsâand some day perhaps SUCH will actually be ourâposthumous glory! Meanwhileâfor there is plenty of time until thenâwe should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance. They are beautiful, glistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth, love of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthfulâthere is something in them that makes one's heart swell with pride. But we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite's conscience, that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment, frippery, and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even under such flattering colour and repainting, the terrible original text HOMO NATURA must again be recognized. In effect, to translate man back again into nature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text, HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline of science, stands before the OTHER forms of nature, with fearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far too long: &quot;Thou art more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!&quot;âthis may be a strange and foolish task, but that it is a TASK, who can deny! Why did we choose it, this foolish task? Or, to put the question differently: &quot;Why knowledge at all?&quot; Every one will ask us about this. And thus pressed, we, who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times, have not found and cannot find any better answer....</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000285\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000285\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>231. Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not merely &quot;conserve&quot;âas the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of our souls, quite &quot;down below,&quot; there is certainly something unteachable, a granite of spiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to predetermined, chosen questions. In each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable &quot;I am this&quot;; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman, for instance, but can only learn fullyâhe can only follow to the end what is &quot;fixed&quot; about them in himself. Occasionally we find certain solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they are henceforth called &quot;convictions.&quot; Later onâone sees in them only footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we ourselves AREâor more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody, our spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in us, quite &quot;down below.&quot;âIn view of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself, permission will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about &quot;woman as she is,&quot; provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are merelyâMY truths.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000286\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000286\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>232. Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to enlighten men about &quot;woman as she is&quot;âTHIS is one of the worst developments of the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must these clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure bring to light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is so much pedantry, superficiality, schoolmasterliness, petty presumption, unbridledness, and indiscretion concealedâstudy only woman's behaviour towards children!âwhich has really been best restrained and dominated hitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas, if ever the &quot;eternally tedious in woman&quot;âshe has plenty of it!âis allowed to venture forth! if she begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-of charming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of alleviating and taking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable desires! Female voices are already raised, which, by Saint Aristophanes! make one afraid:âwith medical explicitness it is stated in a threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man. Is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be scientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's affair, men's giftâwe remained therewith &quot;among ourselves&quot;; and in the end, in view of all that women write about &quot;woman,&quot; we may well have considerable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment about herselfâand CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new ORNAMENT for herselfâI believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally feminine?âwhy, then, she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truthâwhat does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign, more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truthâher great art is falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess it, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the company of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to us. Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart? And is it not true that on the whole &quot;woman&quot; has hitherto been most despised by woman herself, and not at all by us?âWe men desire that woman should not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was man's care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed: mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleon gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in politicis!âand in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls out to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000287\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000287\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>233.

To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of &quot;man and woman,&quot; to deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally hostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal training, equal claims and obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign of shallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at this dangerous spotâshallow in instinct!âmay generally be regarded as suspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as discovered; he will probably prove too &quot;short&quot; for all fundamental questions of life, future as well as present, and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depths.

The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so much respect by men as at presentâthis belongs to the tendency and fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to old ageâwhat wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of this respect? They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is losing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing taste. She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who &quot;unlearns to fear&quot; sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture forward when the fear-inspiring quality in manâor more definitely, the MAN in manâis no longer either desired or fully developed, is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult to understand is that precisely therebyâwoman deteriorates. This is what is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it! Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk: &quot;woman as clerkess&quot; is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in course of formation. While she thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be &quot;master,&quot; and inscribes &quot;progress&quot; of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES. Since the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportion as she has increased her rights and claims; and the &quot;emancipation of woman,&quot; insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves (and not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine stupidity, of which a well-reared womanâwho is always a sensible womanâmight be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps even &quot;to the book,&quot; where formerly she kept herself in control and in refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man's faith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still entails (as though slavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a condition of every higher culture, of every elevation of culture):âwhat does all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminising? Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate all the stupidities from which &quot;man&quot; in Europe, European &quot;manliness,&quot; suffers,âwho would like to lower woman to &quot;general culture,&quot; indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here and there they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless man;âalmost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music (our latest German music), and she is daily being made more hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of bearing robust children. They wish to &quot;cultivate&quot; her in general still more, and intend, as they say, to make the &quot;weaker sex&quot; STRONG by culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the &quot;cultivating&quot; of mankind and his weakeningâthat is to say, the weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILLâhave always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and influential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon) had just to thank their force of willâand not their schoolmastersâfor their power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect in woman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more &quot;natural&quot; than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning flexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism, her untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness, extent, and deviation of her desires and virtues. That which, in spite of fear, excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat, &quot;woman,&quot; is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any other creature. Fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in tragedy, which rends while it delightsâWhat? And all that is now to be at an end? And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The tediousness of woman is slowly evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We know the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee, from which danger is ever again threatening thee! Thy old fable might once more become &quot;history&quot;âan immense stupidity might once again overmaster thee and carry thee away!

I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner's overture to the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy, latter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music as still living, in order that it may be understood:âit is an honour to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavours and forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It impresses us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter, and too modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it is not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarseâit has fire and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits which ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause and effect, an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but already it broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delightâthe most manifold delight,âof old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY the joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his astonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art which he apparently betrays to us. All in all, however, no beauty, no South, nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing of grace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even, which is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us: &quot;It is part of my intention&quot;; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits and witticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of the word, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and inexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude of soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of decadenceâwhich, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a real, genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time young and aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity.

We &quot;good Europeans,&quot; we also have hours when we allow ourselves a warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow viewsâI have just given an example of itâhours of national excitement, of patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods of sentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hoursâin a considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime, according to the speed and strength with which they digest and &quot;change their material.&quot; Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races, which even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to &quot;good Europeanism.&quot; And while digressing on this possibility, I happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two old patriotsâthey were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder. &quot;HE has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as a peasant or a corps-student,&quot; said the oneâ&quot;he is still innocent. But what does that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie on their belly before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis. A statesman who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity of empire and power, they call 'great'âwhat does it matter that we more prudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or affair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of being obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they were by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful mediocrity;âsupposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially politics-practising nations;âsupposing such a statesman were to stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness, an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to depreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make their minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'âwhat! a statesman who should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman would be GREAT, would he?&quot;â&quot;Undoubtedly!&quot; replied the other old patriot vehemently, &quot;otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad perhaps to wish such a thing! But perhaps everything great has been just as mad at its commencement!&quot;â&quot;Misuse of words!&quot; cried his interlocutor, contradictorilyâ&quot;strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!&quot;âThe old men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their &quot;truths&quot; in each other's faces, but I, in my happiness and apartness, considered how soon a stronger one may become master of the strong, and also that there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a nationânamely, in the deepening of another.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000307\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000307\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>242. Whether we call it &quot;civilization,&quot; or &quot;humanising,&quot; or &quot;progress,&quot; which now distinguishes the European, whether we call it simply, without praise or blame, by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in Europeâbehind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on, which is ever extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans, their increasing detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and hereditarily, united races originate, their increasing independence of every definite milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal demands on soul and body,âthat is to say, the slow emergence of an essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who possesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power of adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVING EUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depthâthe still-raging storm and stress of &quot;national sentiment&quot; pertains to it, and also the anarchism which is appearing at presentâthis process will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the apostles of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; would least care to reckon. The same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and mediocrising of man will take placeâa useful, industrious, variously serviceable, and clever gregarious manâare in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and attractive qualities. For, while the capacity for adaptation, which is every day trying changing conditions, and begins a new work with every generation, almost with every decade, makes the POWERFULNESS of the type impossible; while the collective impression of such future Europeans will probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very handy workmen who REQUIRE a master, a commander, as they require their daily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of Europe will tend to the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle sense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever been beforeâowing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise. I meant to say that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntary arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTSâtaking the word in all its meanings, even in its most spiritual sense.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000308\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000308\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>243.

There was a time when it was customary to call Germans &quot;deep&quot; by way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new Germanism is covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses &quot;smartness&quot; in all that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation: in short, whether German depth is not at bottom something different and worseâand something from which, thank God, we are on the point of successfully ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn with regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is a little vivisection of the German soul.âThe German soul is above all manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather than actually built: this is owing to its origin. A German who would embolden himself to assert: &quot;Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast,&quot; would make a bad guess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far short of the truth about the number of souls. As a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-Aryan element as the &quot;people of the centre&quot; in every sense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample, more contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising, and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:âthey escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the despair of the French. It IS characteristic of the Germans that the question: &quot;What is German?&quot; never dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well enough: &quot;We are known,&quot; they cried jubilantly to himâbut Sand also thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared himself incensed at Fichte's lying but patriotic flatteries and exaggerations,âbut it is probable that Goethe thought differently about Germans from Jean Paul, even though he acknowledged him to be right with regard to Fichte. It is a question what Goethe really thought about the Germans?âBut about many things around him he never spoke explicitly, and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silenceâprobably he had good reason for it. It is certain that it was not the &quot;Wars of Independence&quot; that made him look up more joyfully, any more than it was the French Revolution,âthe event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED his &quot;Faust,&quot; and indeed the whole problem of &quot;man,&quot; was the appearance of Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in which he condemns with impatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which Germans take a pride in, he once defined the famous German turn of mind as &quot;Indulgence towards its own and others' weaknesses.&quot; Was he wrong? it is characteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them. The German soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves, hiding-places, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious, the German is well acquainted with the bypaths to chaos. And as everything loves its symbol, so the German loves the clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and shrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain, undeveloped, self-displacing, and growing is &quot;deep&quot;. The German himself does not EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is &quot;developing himself&quot;. &quot;Development&quot; is therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulas,âa ruling idea, which, together with German beer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature at the basis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music). &quot;Good-natured and spiteful&quot;âsuch a juxtaposition, preposterous in the case of every other people, is unfortunately only too often justified in Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians to know this! The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimble boldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any one wishes to see the &quot;German soul&quot; demonstrated ad oculos, let him only look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish indifference to &quot;taste&quot;! How the noblest and the commonest stand there in juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he experiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets &quot;done&quot; with them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating &quot;digestion.&quot; And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what is convenient, so the German loves &quot;frankness&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot;; it is so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!âThis confidingness, this complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can &quot;still achieve much&quot;! The German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty German eyesâand other countries immediately confound him with his dressing-gown!âI meant to say that, let &quot;German depth&quot; be what it willâamong ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at itâwe shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation as a people of depth for Prussian &quot;smartness,&quot; and Berlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and LET itself be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it might even beâprofound to do so! Finally, we should do honour to our nameâwe are not called the &quot;TIUSCHE VOLK&quot; (deceptive people) for nothing....</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000310\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000310\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>245. The &quot;good old&quot; time is past, it sang itself out in Mozartâhow happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his &quot;good company,&quot; his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in the Chinese and its flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the amorous, the tripping, the tearful, and his belief in the South, can still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in us! Ah, some time or other it will be over with it!âbut who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo of a break and transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo of a great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING; there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope,âthe same light in which Europe was bathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the Revolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon. But how rapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does the language of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear, in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to SPEAK, which knew how to SING in Beethoven!âWhatever German music came afterwards, belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a movement which, historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting, and more superficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe from Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. Weberâbut what do WE care nowadays for &quot;Freischutz&quot; and &quot;Oberon&quot;! Or Marschner's &quot;Hans Heiling&quot; and &quot;Vampyre&quot;! Or even Wagner's &quot;Tannhauser&quot;! That is extinct, although not yet forgotten music. This whole music of Romanticism, besides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from the beginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of by genuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly acquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful EPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who took things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the firstâhe was the last that founded a school,âdo we not now regard it as a satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism of Schumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the &quot;Saxon Switzerland&quot; of his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like nature (assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)âhis MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY taste (that is to say, a dangerous propensityâdoubly dangerous among Germansâfor quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGEREâthis Schumann was already merely a GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had been, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000311\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000311\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>246. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has a THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance, which Germans call a &quot;book&quot;! And even the German who READS books! How lazily, how reluctantly, how badly he reads! How many Germans know, and consider it obligatory to know, that there is ART in every good sentenceâart which must be divined, if the sentence is to be understood! If there is a misunderstanding about its TEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself is misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about the rhythm-determining syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the too-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a fine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangementâwho among book-reading Germans is complaisant enough to recognize such duties and requirements, and to listen to so much art and intention in language? After all, one just &quot;has no ear for it&quot;; and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard, and the most delicate artistry is as it were SQUANDERED on the deaf.âThese were my thoughts when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose-writing have been confounded: one, whose words drop down hesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp caveâhe counts on their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his language like a flexible sword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to bite, hiss, and cut.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000312\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000312\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>247. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with the ear, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves write badly. The German does not read aloud, he does not read for the ear, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for the time. In antiquity when a man readâwhich was seldom enoughâhe read something to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when any one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. In a loud voice: that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and variations of key and changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC world took delight. The laws of the written style were then the same as those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx; partly on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. In the ancient sense, a period is above all a physiological whole, inasmuch as it is comprised in one breath. Such periods as occur in Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling twice and sinking twice, and all in one breath, were pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty in the deliverance of such a period;âWE have really no right to the BIG period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every sense! Those ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in speaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently criticsâthey thus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song (and with it also the art of melody) reached its elevation. In Germany, however (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there was properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical discourseâthat delivered from the pulpit. The preacher was the only one in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom attained by a German, or almost always too late. The masterpiece of German prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best German book. Compared with Luther's Bible, almost everything else is merely &quot;literature&quot;âsomething which has not grown in Germany, and therefore has not taken and does not take root in German hearts, as the Bible has done.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000313\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000313\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>248.

It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and disturbancesâin short, slight attacks of stupidityâpass over the spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national nervous fever and political ambition: for instance, among present-day Germans there is alternately the anti-French folly, the anti-Semitic folly, the anti-Polish folly, the Christian-romantic folly, the Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic folly, the Prussian folly (just look at those poor historians, the Sybels and Treitschkes, and their closely bandaged heads), and whatever else these little obscurations of the German spirit and conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me that I, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground, did not remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one else, began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern meâthe first symptom of political infection. About the Jews, for instance, listen to the following:âI have never yet met a German who was favourably inclined to the Jews; and however decided the repudiation of actual anti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men, this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess, and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentiment;âon this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germany has amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the German blood, has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only of this quantity of &quot;Jew&quot;âas the Italian, the Frenchman, and the Englishman have done by means of a stronger digestion:âthat is the unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct, to which one must listen and according to which one must act. &quot;Let no more Jews come in! And shut the doors, especially towards the East (also towards Austria)!&quot;âthus commands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by a stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest, toughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they know how to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than under favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would like nowadays to label as vicesâowing above all to a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before &quot;modern ideas&quot;, they alter only, WHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian Empire makes its conquestâas an empire that has plenty of time and is not of yesterdayânamely, according to the principle, &quot;as slowly as possible&quot;! A thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, will, in all his perspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he will calculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and likeliest factors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at present called a &quot;nation&quot; in Europe, and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA (indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in every case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet a race, much less such a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such &quot;nations&quot; should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry and hostility! It is certain that the Jews, if they desiredâor if they were driven to it, as the anti-Semites seem to wishâCOULD now have the ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT working and planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, they rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by Europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the &quot;wandering Jew&quot;,âand one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency, and MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the Jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country. One should make advances with all prudence, and with selection, pretty much as the English nobility do It stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new Germanism could enter into relation with the Jews with the least hesitation, for instance, the nobleman officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many ways to see whether the genius for money and patience (and especially some intellect and intellectualityâsadly lacking in the place referred to) could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeyingâfor both of which the country in question has now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my SERIOUS TOPIC, the &quot;European problem,&quot; as I understand it, the rearing of a new ruling caste for Europe.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000317\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000317\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>252. They are not a philosophical raceâthe English: Bacon represents an ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally, Hobbes, Hume, and Locke, an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a &quot;philosopher&quot; for more than a century. It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself; it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said, &quot;JE MEPRISE LOCKE&quot;; in the struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world, Hegel and Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the two hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different directions towards the opposite poles of German thought, and thereby wronged each other as only brothers will do.âWhat is lacking in England, and has always been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head, Carlyle, who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely, what was LACKING in Carlyleâreal POWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual perception, in short, philosophy. It is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianityâthey NEED its discipline for &quot;moralizing&quot; and humanizing. The Englishman, more gloomy, sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the Germanâis for that very reason, as the baser of the two, also the most pious: he has all the MORE NEED of Christianity. To finer nostrils, this English Christianity itself has still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic excess, for which, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidoteâthe finer poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards spiritualization. The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or, more correctly, it is thereby explained and differently expressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism (and more recently as the &quot;Salvation Army&quot;), a penitential fit may really be the relatively highest manifestation of &quot;humanity&quot; to which they can be elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. That, however, which offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music, to speak figuratively (and also literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body; indeed, not even the desire for rhythm and dance, for &quot;music.&quot; Listen to him speaking; look at the most beautiful Englishwoman WALKINGâin no country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans; finally, listen to them singing!

There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds, because they are best adapted for them, there are truths which only possess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits:âone is pushed to this probably unpleasant conclusion, now that the influence of respectable but mediocre EnglishmenâI may mention Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencerâbegins to gain the ascendancy in the middle-class region of European taste. Indeed, who could doubt that it is a useful thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time? It would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many little common facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions, they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards those who are &quot;the rules.&quot; After all, they have more to do than merely to perceive:âin effect, they have to BE something new, they have to SIGNIFY something new, they have to REPRESENT new values!

In fact, a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawls in the foregroundâit recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste, and at the same time of self-admiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo. There is also something else common to them: a predilection to resist intellectual Germanizingâand a still greater inability to do so! In this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism, Schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine, who has long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists of Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the form of Taineâthe FIRST of living historiansâexercises an almost tyrannical influence. As regards Richard Wagner, however, the more French music learns to adapt itself to the actual needs of the AME MODERNE, the more will it &quot;Wagnerite&quot;; one can safely predict that beforehand,âit is already taking place sufficiently! There are, however, three things which the French can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession, and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority in Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and vulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for devotion to &quot;form,&quot; for which the expression, L'ART POUR L'ART, along with numerous others, has been invented:âsuch capacity has not been lacking in France for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for the &quot;small number,&quot; it has again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere in Europe.âThe SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to a superiority over Europe is their ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty ROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany. The Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite thereto, which, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who call the Germans &quot;naive&quot; on that account give them commendation for a defect. (As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE PSYCHOLOGICA, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness of German intercourse,âand as the most successful expression of genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate thrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS Europe, in fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a surveyor and discoverer thereof:âit has required two generations to OVERTAKE him one way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the riddles that perplexed and enraptured himâthis strange Epicurean and man of interrogation, the last great psychologist of France).âThere is yet a THIRD claim to superiority: in the French character there is a successful half-way synthesis of the North and South, which makes them comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, which an Englishman can never comprehend. Their temperament, turned alternately to and from the South, in which from time to time the Provencal and Ligurian blood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern grey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of bloodâour GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that is to say &quot;high politics,&quot; has with great resolution been prescribed (according to a dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet hope).âThere is also still in France a pre-understanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the Southâthe born Midlanders, the &quot;good Europeans.&quot; For them BIZET has made music, this latest genius, who has seen a new beauty and seduction,âwho has discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000322\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000322\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>255. I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music. Suppose a person loves the South as I love itâas a great school of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a boundless solar profusion and effulgence which o'erspreads a sovereign existence believing in itselfâwell, such a person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against German music, because, in injuring his taste anew, it will also injure his health anew. Such a Southerner, a Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future of music, must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the North; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music, which does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music does, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of skyâa super-European music, which holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, whose soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey... I could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps some sailor's home-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would see the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing towards it, and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000323\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000323\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>256. Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing also to the short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude policyâowing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable at present, the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE, are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. With all the more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to anticipate the European of the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in old age perhaps, did they belong to the &quot;fatherlands&quot;âthey only rested from themselves when they became &quot;patriots.&quot; I think of such men as Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings (geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves), still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and opposed in France: the fact remains, nevertheless, that Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties, are most closely and intimately related to one another. They are akin, fundamentally akin, in all the heights and depths of their requirements; it is Europe, the ONE Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly, outwards and upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous artâwhither? into a new light? towards a new sun? But who would attempt to express accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly? It is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them, that they SOUGHT in the same manner, these last great seekers! All of them steeped in literature to their eyes and earsâthe first artists of universal literary cultureâfor the most part even themselves writers, poets, intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses (Wagner, as musician is reckoned among painters, as poet among musicians, as artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics for EXPRESSION &quot;at any cost&quot;âI specially mention Delacroix, the nearest related to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of the sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still greater discoverers in effect, in display, in the art of the show-shop; all of them talented far beyond their genius, out and out VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses to all that seduces, allures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of logic and of the straight line, hankering after the strange, the exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men, Tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to be incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and actionâthink of Balzac, for instance,âunrestrained workers, almost destroying themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners, ambitious and insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finally shattering and sinking down at the Christian cross (and with right and reason, for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and sufficiently original for an ANTI-CHRISTIAN philosophy?);âon the whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their centuryâand it is the century of the MASSESâthe conception &quot;higher man.&quot;... Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together as to whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER-GERMAN sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underrated how indispensable Paris was to the development of his type, which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most decisive timeâand how the whole style of his proceedings, of his self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the French socialistic original. On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be found, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German nature, that he has acted in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation than a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have doneâowing to the circumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the French;âperhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried, that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too cheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow civilized nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad days, whenâanticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into politicsâhe began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least, THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.âThat these last words may not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I meanâwhat I mean COUNTER TO the &quot;last Wagner&quot; and his Parsifal music:â</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000324\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000324\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>âIs this our mode?âFrom German heart came this vexed ululating?

EVERY elevation of the type &quot;man,&quot; has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always beâa society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings, and requiring slavery in some form or other. Without the PATHOS OF DISTANCE, such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes, out of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on subordinates and instruments, and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a distanceâthat other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen, the longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself, the formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more comprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of the type &quot;man,&quot; the continued &quot;self-surmounting of man,&quot; to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense. To be sure, one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an aristocratic society (that is to say, of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type &quot;man&quot;): the truth is hard. Let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED! Men with a still natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of the word, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of will and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more moral, more peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities), or upon old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. At the commencement, the noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority did not consist first of all in their physical, but in their psychical powerâthey were more COMPLETE men (which at every point also implies the same as &quot;more complete beasts&quot;).</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000329\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000329\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>258. Corruptionâas the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among the instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called &quot;life,&quot; is convulsedâis something radically different according to the organization in which it manifests itself. When, for instance, an aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution, flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral sentiments, it was corruption:âit was really only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries, by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in the end even to its decoration and parade-dress). The essential thing, however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but as the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereofâthat it should therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals, who, FOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men, to slaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but only as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-seeking climbing plants in Javaâthey are called Sipo Matador,âwhich encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but supported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and exhibit their happiness.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000330\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000330\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>259. To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation, and put one's will on a par with that of others: this may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary conditions are given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and degree of worth, and their co-relation within one organization). As soon, however, as one wished to take this principle more generally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY, it would immediately disclose what it really isânamely, a Will to the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and decay. Here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest, exploitation;âbut why should one for ever use precisely these words on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped? Even the organization within which, as was previously supposed, the individuals treat each other as equalâit takes place in every healthy aristocracyâmust itself, if it be a living and not a dying organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the individuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain ground, attract to itself and acquire ascendancyânot owing to any morality or immorality, but because it LIVES, and because life IS precisely Will to Power. On no point, however, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave everywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming conditions of society in which &quot;the exploiting character&quot; is to be absentâthat sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should refrain from all organic functions. &quot;Exploitation&quot; does not belong to a depraved, or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence of the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the Will to LifeâGranting that as a theory this is a noveltyâas a reality it is the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000331\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000331\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>260. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits recurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical distinction was brought to light. There is MASTER-MORALITY and SLAVE-MORALITY,âI would at once add, however, that in all higher and mixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close juxtapositionâeven in the same man, within one soul. The distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruledâor among the ruled class, the slaves and dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is the rulers who determine the conception &quot;good,&quot; it is the exalted, proud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines the order of rank. The noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud disposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be noted that in this first kind of morality the antithesis &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; means practically the same as &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;despicable&quot;,âthe antithesis &quot;good&quot; and &quot;EVIL&quot; is of a different origin. The cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained glances, the self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused, the mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:âit is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. &quot;We truthful ones&quot;âthe nobility in ancient Greece called themselves. It is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to MEN; and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals start with questions like, &quot;Why have sympathetic actions been praised?&quot; The noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: &quot;What is injurious to me is injurious in itself;&quot; he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:âthe noble man also helps the unfortunate, but notâor scarcelyâout of pity, but rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has reverence for all that is severe and hard. &quot;Wotan placed a hard heart in my breast,&quot; says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly: &quot;He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one.&quot; The noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in DESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards &quot;selflessness,&quot; belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the &quot;warm heart.&quot;âIt is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention. The profound reverence for age and for traditionâall law rests on this double reverence,âthe belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of the powerful; and if, reversely, men of &quot;modern ideas&quot; believe almost instinctively in &quot;progress&quot; and the &quot;future,&quot; and are more and more lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these &quot;ideas&quot; has complacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling class, however, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's equals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or &quot;as the heart desires,&quot; and in any case &quot;beyond good and evil&quot;: it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a place. The ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revengeâboth only within the circle of equals,âartfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arroganceâin fact, in order to be a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of &quot;modern ideas,&quot; and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to unearth and disclose.âIt is otherwise with the second type of morality, SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates? Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of everything &quot;good&quot; that is there honouredâhe would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence, humility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most useful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of existence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility. Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;:âpower and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not admit of being despised. According to slave-morality, therefore, the &quot;evil&quot; man arouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely the &quot;good&quot; man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum when, in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a shade of depreciationâit may be slight and well-intentionedâat last attaches itself to the &quot;good&quot; man of this morality; because, according to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in any case be the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un bonhomme. Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words &quot;good&quot; and &quot;stupid.&quot;âA last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM, the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.âHence we can understand without further detail why love AS A PASSIONâit is our European specialtyâmust absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the &quot;gai saber,&quot; to whom Europe owes so much, and almost owes itself.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000332\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000332\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>261. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not possessâand consequently also do not &quot;deserve,&quot;âand who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion afterwards. This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so self-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable, that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful about it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say, for instance: &quot;I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely as I rate it:âthat, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit, or, in most cases, that which is called 'humility,' and also 'modesty').&quot; Or he will even say: &quot;For many reasons I can delight in the good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour them, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do not share it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:âall this, however, is not vanity.&quot; The man of noble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from time immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary man WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:ânot being at all accustomed to fix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value than that which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to create values). It may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still always WAITING for an opinion about himself, and then instinctively submitting himself to it; yet by no means only to a &quot;good&quot; opinion, but also to a bad and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of the self-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn from their confessors, and which in general the believing Christian learns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood of masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to &quot;think well&quot; of themselves, will now be more and more encouraged and extended; but it has at all times an older, ampler, and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to itâand in the phenomenon of &quot;vanity&quot; this older propensity overmasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERY good opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point of view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.âIt is &quot;the slave&quot; in the vain man's blood, the remains of the slave's craftinessâand how much of the &quot;slave&quot; is still left in woman, for instance!âwhich seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions, as though he had not called them forth.âAnd to repeat it again: vanity is an atavism.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000333\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000333\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>262. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions. On the other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species which receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of protection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in monstrous vices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say an ancient Greek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance for the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men beside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to make their species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or else run the terrible danger of being exterminated. The favour, the super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which variations are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as something which, precisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of structure, can in general prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious or rebellion-threatening vassals. The most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists, in spite of all Gods and men, and has hitherto been victorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone it develops to maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires severity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the relations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only for the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues, under the name of &quot;justice.&quot; A type with few, but very marked features, a species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent men (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the vicissitudes of generations; the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type becoming stable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of things results, the enormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among the neighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the enjoyment of life, are present in superabundance. With one stroke the bond and constraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as necessary, as a condition of existenceâif it would continue, it can only do so as a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations, whether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual and detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifest themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary decay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms, which strive with one another &quot;for sun and light,&quot; and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. It was this morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously, which bent the bow in so threatening a manner:âit is now &quot;out of date,&quot; it is getting &quot;out of date.&quot; The dangerous and disquieting point has been reached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS LIVED BEYOND the old morality; the &quot;individual&quot; stands out, and is obliged to have recourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and artifices for self-preservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance. Nothing but new &quot;Whys,&quot; nothing but new &quot;Hows,&quot; no common formulas any longer, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay, deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad, a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied corruption. Danger is again present, the mother of morality, great danger; this time shifted into the individual, into the neighbour and friend, into the street, into their own child, into their own heart, into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers, that the end is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays and produces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow, except one species of man, the incurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselvesâthey will be the men of the future, the sole survivors; &quot;be like them! become mediocre!&quot; is now the only morality which has still a significance, which still obtains a hearing.âBut it is difficult to preach this morality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it desires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly loveâit will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000334\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000334\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>263. There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else is already the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. The refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test when something passes by that is of the highest rank, but is not yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and incivilities: something that goes its way like a living touchstone, undistinguished, undiscovered, and tentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled and disguised. He whose task and practice it is to investigate souls, will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which it belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE. DIFFERENCE ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any book bearing the marks of great destiny, is brought before it; while on the other hand, there is an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of all gestures, by which it is indicated that a soul FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect. The way in which, on the whole, the reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained in Europe, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such profoundness and supreme significance require for their protection an external tyranny of authority, in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousands of years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. Much has been achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses (the shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not allowed to touch everything, that there are holy experiences before which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean handâit is almost their highest advance towards humanity. On the contrary, in the so-called cultured classes, the believers in &quot;modern ideas,&quot; nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger everything; and it is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste, and more tact for reverence among the people, among the lower classes of the people, especially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading DEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000335\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000335\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>264. It cannot be effaced from a man's soul what his ancestors have preferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like in their desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were accustomed to commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether, finally, at one time or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of birth and possession, in order to live wholly for their faithâfor their &quot;God,&quot;âas men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which blushes at every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. This is the problem of race. Granted that one knows something of the parents, it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind of offensive incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy self-vauntingâthe three things which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type in all timesâsuch must pass over to the child, as surely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.âAnd what else does education and culture try to do nowadays!

At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief that to a being such as &quot;we,&quot; other beings must naturally be in subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things:âif he sought a designation for it he would say: &quot;It is justice itself.&quot; He acknowledges under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect, which he enjoys in intercourse with himselfâin accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. It is an ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation in intercourse with his equalsâevery star is a similar egoist; he honours HIMSELF in them, and in the rights which he concedes to them, he has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as the ESSENCE of all intercourse, belongs also to the natural condition of things. The noble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital, which is at the root of his nature. The notion of &quot;favour&quot; has, INTER PARES, neither significance nor good repute; there may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from above, and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude.

What, after all, is ignobleness?âWords are vocal symbols for ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols for frequently returning and concurring sensations, for groups of sensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words in order to understand one another: we must also employ the same words for the same kind of internal experiences, we must in the end have experiences IN COMMON. On this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations, even when they use the same language; or rather, when people have lived long together under similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there ORIGINATES therefrom an entity that &quot;understands itself&quot;ânamely, a nation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more rapidlyâthe history of language is the history of a process of abbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people always unite closer and closer. The greater the danger, the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not to misunderstand one another in dangerâthat is what cannot at all be dispensed with in intercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words, one of the two parties has feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears different from those of the other. (The fear of the &quot;eternal misunderstanding&quot;: that is the good genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from too hasty attachments, to which sense and heart prompt themâand NOT some Schopenhauerian &quot;genius of the species&quot;!) Whichever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the word of commandâthese decide as to the general order of rank of its values, and determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A man's estimates of value betray something of the STRUCTURE of his soul, and wherein it sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic needs. Supposing now that necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols, it results on the whole that the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need, which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and COMMON experiences, must have been the most potent of all the forces which have hitherto operated upon mankind. The more similar, the more ordinary people, have always had and are still having the advantage; the more select, more refined, more unique, and difficultly comprehensible, are liable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation, and seldom propagate themselves. One must appeal to immense opposing forces, in order to thwart this natural, all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE, the evolution of man to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the gregariousâto the IGNOBLEâ!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000340\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000340\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>269. The more a psychologistâa born, an unavoidable psychologist and soul-divinerâturns his attention to the more select cases and individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner &quot;desperateness&quot; of higher men, this eternal &quot;too late!&quot; in every senseâmay perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destructionâof his &quot;going to ruin&quot; himself. One may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisivenessâfrom what his &quot;business&quot;âhas laid upon his conscience. The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour, admire, love, and glorify, where he has PERCEIVEDâor he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt GREAT SYMPATHY, together with great CONTEMPT, the multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great reverenceâreverence for &quot;great men&quot; and marvelous animals, for the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the earth, the dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young, and in view of whom one educates them. And who knows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped a God, and that the &quot;God&quot; was only a poor sacrificial animal! SUCCESS has always been the greatest liarâand the &quot;work&quot; itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations until they are unrecognizable; the &quot;work&quot; of the artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is REPUTED to have created it; the &quot;great men,&quot; as they are reverenced, are poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values spurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets, for example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the Will-o'-the-Wisps around the swamps, and PRETEND TO BE starsâthe people then call them idealists,âoften struggling with protracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish for GLORIA and devour &quot;faith as it is&quot; out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:âwhat a TORMENT these great artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from womanâwho is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powersâthat THEY have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted SYMPATHY, which the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that love can do EVERYTHINGâit is the SUPERSTITION peculiar to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love isâhe finds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!âIt is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that DEMANDED love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send thither those who WOULD NOT love himâand that at last, enlightened about human love, had to invent a God who is entire love, entire CAPACITY for loveâwho takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such KNOWLEDGE about loveâSEEKS for death!âBut why should one deal with such painful matters?

Profound suffering makes noble: it separates.âOne of the most refined forms of disguise is Epicurism, along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste, which takes suffering lightly, and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound.

There are &quot;scientific minds&quot; who make use of science, because it gives a gay appearance, and because scientificness leads to the conclusion that a person is superficialâthey WISH to mislead to a false conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would fain conceal and deny that they are broken, proud, incurable hearts (the cynicism of Hamletâthe case of Galiani); and occasionally folly itself is the mask of an unfortunate OVER-ASSURED knowledge.âFrom which it follows that it is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence &quot;for the mask,&quot; and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000342\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/d52f4e9d803f90a6/text/000000342\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-8f4a13 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-80d910 twpub-d52f4e9d803f90a6-6b4cd0\\\"><p>271.

In the meantime, however, I have learned much, far too much, about the philosophy of this God, and, as I said, from mouth to mouthâI, the last disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last begin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little taste of this philosophy? In a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do with much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny. The very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also philosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;âamong you, my friends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too late and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may happen, too, that in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears? Certainly the God in question went further, very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of me... Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him, according to human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless honesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But such a God does not know what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. &quot;Keep that,&quot; he would say, &quot;for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require it! Iâhave no reason to cover my nakedness!&quot; One suspects that this kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?âHe once said: &quot;Under certain circumstances I love mankind&quot;âand referred thereby to Ariadne, who was present; &quot;in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave, inventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way even through all labyrinths. I like man, and often think how I can still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more profound.&quot;â&quot;Stronger, more evil, and more profound?&quot; I asked in horror. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said again, &quot;stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more beautiful&quot;âand thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile, as though he had just paid some charming compliment. One here sees at once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;âand in general there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could all of them come to us men for instruction.

from\\n<br>people in all walks of life.\\n<br>\\n<br>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\n<br>assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\n<br>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\n<br>remain freely available for generations to come.Â  In 2001, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\n<br>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\n<br>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
