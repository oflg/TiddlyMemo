which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic. Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000013\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000013\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000014\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000014\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place was bewitched by a High German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare, with her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000015\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000015\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head.

His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000016\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000016\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000017\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000017\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time.

He was a native of Connecticut, a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters. The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person. He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew. To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000020\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000020\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks. It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and stakes set against the window shutters; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment in getting out,—an idea most probably borrowed by the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eelpot. The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it. From hence the low murmur of his pupils’ voices, conning over their lessons, might be heard in a drowsy summer’s day, like the hum of a beehive; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or command, or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge.

The fireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch’s token. His only resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with awe at hearing his nasal melody, “in linked sweetness long drawn out,” floating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000028\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000028\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him.

Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those everything was snug, happy and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well formed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard, and Guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart,—sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000033\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000033\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The pedagogue’s mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare.

In the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up, with its gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back, in a side dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000034\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000034\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized his hopes, and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for Kentucky, Tennessee,—or the Lord knows where!</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000035\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000035\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>When he entered the house, the conquest of his heart was complete. It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged but lowly sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion, and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner stood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored birds eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000036\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000036\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight, the peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel. In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass, and walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was confined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie; and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and impediments; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000037\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000037\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Among these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood.

From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES, by which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal. He was always ready for either a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or four boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox’s tail; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, “Ay, there goes Brom Bones and his gang!” The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe, admiration, and good-will; and, when any madcap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000038\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000038\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his hopes.

Ichabod, therefore, made his advances in a quiet and gently insinuating manner. Under cover of his character of singing-master, he made frequent visits at the farmhouse; not that he had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even than his pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let her have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, had enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry; for, as she sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of themselves. Thus, while the busy dame bustled about the house, or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other, watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn. In the mean time, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover’s eloquence.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000041\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000041\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>I profess not to know how women’s hearts are wooed and won. To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero. Certain it is, this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former evidently declined: his horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000042\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000042\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore,—by single combat; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists against him; he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he would “double the schoolmaster up, and lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse;” and he was too wary to give him an opportunity. There was something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival. Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked out his singing school by stopping up the chimney; broke into the schoolhouse at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there. But what was still more annoying, Brom took all opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod’s, to instruct her in psalmody.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000043\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000043\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>In this way matters went on for some time, without producing any material effect on the relative situations of the contending powers. On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on the lofty stool from whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little literary realm. In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne, a constant terror to evil doers, while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons of idle urchins, such as half-munched apples, popguns, whirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper gamecocks. Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth jacket and trowsers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter. He came clattering up to the school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making or “quilting frolic,” to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel’s; and having delivered his message with that air of importance, and effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his mission.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000044\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000044\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom. The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word. Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000045\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000045\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only suit of rusty black, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that hung up in the schoolhouse.

But it is meet I should, in the true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was a broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything but its viciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck, and a head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burs; one eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder. He had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master’s, the choleric Van Ripper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked, there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in the country.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000046\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000046\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed.

A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horses tail.

A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move them.

There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel’s, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful legends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major André was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood. Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow. The chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling the country; and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000063\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000063\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll, surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the shades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night. Such was one of the favorite haunts of the Headless Horseman, and the place where he was most frequently encountered. The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he met the Horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the bridge; when the Horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap of thunder.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000064\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000064\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey.

Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains, and their light-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter, until they gradually died away,—and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted. Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of country lovers, to have a tête-à-tête with the heiress; fully convinced that he was now on the high road to success. What passed at this interview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know. Something, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chapfallen. Oh, these women! these women! Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks? Was her encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival? Heaven only knows, not I! Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had been sacking a henroost, rather than a fair lady’s heart. Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth, on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to the stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly sleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole valleys of timothy and clover.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000067\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000067\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy-hearted and crestfallen, pursued his travels homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as dismal as himself. Far below him the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the tall mast of a sloop, riding quietly at anchor under the land. In the dead hush of midnight, he could even hear the barking of the watchdog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful companion of man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some farmhouse away among the hills—but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear. No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in his bed.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000068\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000068\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon now came crowding upon his recollection.

He was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid. In the centre of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree, which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the neighborhood, and formed a kind of landmark. Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into the air. It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate André, who had been taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known by the name of Major André’s tree. The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill-starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange sights, and doleful lamentations, told concerning it.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000069\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000069\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; he thought his whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches.

A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines, threw a cavernous gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest trial. It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate André was captured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him.

Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000072\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000072\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror.

Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with involuntary fervor into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound stood at once in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. He made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000073\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000073\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping Hessian, now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind. The stranger, however, quickened his horse to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled up, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind,—the other did the same. His heart began to sink within him; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a rising ground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless!—but his horror was still more increased on observing that the head, which should have rested on his shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel of his saddle! His terror rose to desperation; he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder, hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion the slip; but the spectre started full jump with him. Away, then, they dashed through thick and thin; stones flying and sparks flashing at every bound. Ichabod’s flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse’s head, in the eagerness of his flight.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000074\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000074\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged headlong downhill to the left.

He seized it by the pommel, and endeavored to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it trampled under foot by his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper’s wrath passed across his mind,—for it was his Sunday saddle; but this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his haunches; and (unskilful rider that he was!) he had much ado to maintain his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse’s backbone, with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him asunder.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000076\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000076\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>An opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church bridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken. He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond. He recollected the place where Brom Bones’s ghostly competitor had disappeared. “If I can but reach that bridge,” thought Ichabod, “I am safe.” Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied that he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding planks; he gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone. Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash,—he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000077\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000077\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master’s gate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast; dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster. Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod, and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses’ hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000078\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000078\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper as executor of his estate, examined the bundle which contained all his worldly effects. They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy small-clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes full of dog’s-ears; and a broken pitch-pipe. As to the books and furniture of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community, excepting Cotton Mather’s “History of Witchcraft,” a “New England Almanac,” and a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel. These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper; who, from that time forward, determined to send his children no more to school, observing that he never knew any good come of this same reading and writing.

Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the churchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin had been found. The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of others were called to mind; and when they had diligently considered them all, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook their heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried off by the Galloping Hessian.

Brom Bones, too, who, shortly after his rival’s disappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin; which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell.</p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000081\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/4a9ab6acb404f468/text/000000081\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-ffb9d7 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-12c8c9 twpub-4a9ab6acb404f468-6b4cd0\\\"><p>The old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these matters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told about the neighborhood round the winter evening fire.

There was, however, one tall, dry-looking old gentleman, with beetling eyebrows, who maintained a grave and rather severe face throughout, now and then folding his arms, inclining his head, and looking down upon the floor, as if turning a doubt over in his mind. He was one of your wary men, who never laugh but upon good grounds--when they have reason and law on their side.

copyright royalties.  Special rules,\\n<br>set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to\\n<br>copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to\\n<br>protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project\\n<br>Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you\\n<br>charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you\\n<br>do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the\\n<br>rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose\\n<br>such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and\\n<br>research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do\\n<br>practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is\\n<br>subject to the trademark license, especially commercial\\n<br>redistribution.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>*** START: FULL LICENSE ***\\n<br>\\n<br>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE\\n<br>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK\\n<br>\\n<br>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free\\n<br>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work\\n<br>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project\\n<br>Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at\\n<br>http://gutenberg.org/license).\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic works\\n<br>\\n<br>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to\\n<br>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property\\n<br>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all\\n<br>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy\\n<br>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.\\n<br>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the\\n<br>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or\\n<br>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.B.  “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark.  It may only be\\n<br>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who\\n<br>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few\\n<br>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n<br>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See\\n<br>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement\\n<br>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\n<br>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation”\\n<br> or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the\\n<br>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an\\n<br>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are\\n<br>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from\\n<br>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative\\n<br>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg\\n<br>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by\\n<br>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of\\n<br>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with\\n<br>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by\\n<br>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\\n<br>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in\\n<br>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check\\n<br>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement\\n<br>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or\\n<br>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning\\n<br>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United\\n<br>States.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate\\n<br>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently\\n<br>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the\\n<br>phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project\\n<br>Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,\\n<br>copied or distributed:\\n<br>\\n<br>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\\n<br>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or\\n<br>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\\n<br>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived\\n<br>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is\\n<br>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied\\n<br>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees\\n<br>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work\\n<br>with the phrase “Project Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the\\n<br>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1\\n<br>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or\\n<br>1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted\\n<br>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution\\n<br>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional\\n<br>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked\\n<br>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the\\n<br>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this\\n<br>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this\\n<br>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without\\n<br>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with\\n<br>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,\\n<br>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any\\n<br>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or\\n<br>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than\\n<br>“Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version\\n<br>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),\\n<br>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a\\n<br>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon\\n<br>request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other\\n<br>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,\\n<br>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works\\n<br>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing\\n<br>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided\\n<br>that\\n<br>\\n<br>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from\\n<br>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method\\n<br>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is\\n<br>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he\\n<br>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the\\n<br>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments\\n<br>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you\\n<br>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax\\n<br>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and\\n<br>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the\\n<br>     address specified in Section 4, “Information about donations to\\n<br>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.”\\n<br> \\n<br>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies\\n<br>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\\n<br>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>     License.  You must require such a user to return or\\n<br>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium\\n<br>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of\\n<br>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.\\n<br>\\n<br>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any\\n<br>     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the\\n<br>     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days\\n<br>     of receipt of the work.\\n<br>\\n<br>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free\\n<br>     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set\\n<br>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from\\n<br>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael\\n<br>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the\\n<br>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\\n<br>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\\n<br>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\n<br>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\\n<br>“Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\\n<br>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\\n<br>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\\n<br>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\\n<br>your equipment.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right\\n<br>of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\n<br>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\n<br>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\\n<br>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\\n<br>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\\n<br>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\\n<br>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\\n<br>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\\n<br>DAMAGE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\\n<br>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\\n<br>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\\n<br>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\\n<br>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\\n<br>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\\n<br>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\\n<br>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\\n<br>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\\n<br>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\\n<br>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\\n<br>opportunities to fix the problem.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\\n<br>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’ WITH NO OTHER\\n<br>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\\n<br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\\n<br>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\\n<br>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\\n<br>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\\n<br>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\\n<br>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\\n<br>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\n<br>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\n<br>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\\n<br>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\\n<br>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\\n<br>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\\n<br>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\\n<br>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\n<br>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\n<br>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\n<br>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\n<br>people in all walks of life.\\n<br>\\n<br>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\n<br>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s\\n<br>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\n<br>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\n<br>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\n<br>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n<br>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\n<br>and the Foundation web page at

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\n<br>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\n<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\n<br>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\n<br>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n<br>\\n<br>     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\n<br>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\n<br>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\n<br>subscribe to our email
