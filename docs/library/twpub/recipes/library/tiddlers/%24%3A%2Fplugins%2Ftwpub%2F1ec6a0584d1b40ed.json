After apologizing for his ignorance, and reminding the audience that slavery was a poor school for the human intellect and heart, he proceeded to narrate some of the facts in his own history as a slave, and in the course of his speech gave utterance to many noble thoughts and thrilling reflections.

So I believed at that time—such is my belief now. I reminded the audience of the peril which surrounded this self-emancipated young man at the North,—even in Massachusetts, on the soil of the Pilgrim Fathers, among the descendants of revolutionary sires; and I appealed to them, whether they would ever allow him to be carried back into slavery,—law or no law, constitution or no constitution. The response was unanimous and in thunder-tones—“NO!” “Will you succor and protect him as a brother-man—a resident of the old Bay State?” “YES!” shouted the whole mass, with an energy so startling, that the ruthless tyrants south of Mason and Dixon’s line might almost have heard the mighty burst of feeling, and recognized it as the pledge of an invincible determination, on the part of those who gave it, never to betray him that wanders, but to hide the outcast, and firmly to abide the consequences.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000030\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000030\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000031\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000031\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>It was at once deeply impressed upon my mind, that, if Mr. D<small>OUGLASS</small> could be persuaded to consecrate his time and talents to the promotion of the anti-slavery enterprise, a powerful impetus would be given to it, and a stunning blow at the same time inflicted on northern prejudice against a colored complexion.

At first, he could give no encouragement; with unfeigned diffidence, he expressed his conviction that he was not adequate to the performance of so great a task; the path marked out was wholly an untrodden one; he was sincerely apprehensive that he should do more harm than good. After much deliberation, however, he consented to make a trial; and ever since that period, he has acted as a lecturing agent, under the auspices either of the American or the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. In labors he has been most abundant; and his success in combating prejudice, in gaining proselytes, in agitating the public mind, has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations that were raised at the commencement of his brilliant career. He has borne himself with gentleness and meekness, yet with true manliness of character. As a public speaker, he excels in pathos, wit, comparison, imitation, strength of reasoning, and fluency of language. There is in him that union of head and heart, which is indispensable to an enlightenment of the heads and a winning of the hearts of others. May his strength continue to be equal to his day!

Nothing has been left undone to cripple their intellects, darken their minds, debase their moral nature, obliterate all traces of their relationship to mankind; and yet how wonderfully they have sustained the mighty load of a most frightful bondage, under which they have been groaning for centuries! To illustrate the effect of slavery on the white man,—to show that he has no powers of endurance, in such a condition, superior to those of his black brother,—<i>Daniel O’Connell</i>, the distinguished advocate of universal emancipation, and the mightiest champion of prostrate but not conquered Ireland, relates the following anecdote in a speech delivered by him in the Conciliation Hall, Dublin, before the Loyal National Repeal Association, March 31, 1845. “No matter,” said <i>Mr. O’Connell</i>, “under what specious term it may disguise itself, slavery is still hideous. <i>It has a natural, an inevitable tendency to brutalize every noble faculty of man.</i> An American sailor, who was cast away on the shore of Africa, where he was kept in slavery for three years, was, at the expiration of that period, found to be imbruted and stultified—he had lost all reasoning power; and having forgotten his native language, could only utter some savage gibberish between Arabic and English, which nobody could understand, and which even he himself found difficulty in pronouncing.

He who can peruse it without a tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit,—without being filled with an unutterable abhorrence of slavery and all its abettors, and animated with a determination to seek the immediate overthrow of that execrable system,—without trembling for the fate of this country in the hands of a righteous God, who is ever on the side of the oppressed, and whose arm is not shortened that it cannot save,—must have a flinty heart, and be qualified to act the part of a trafficker “in slaves and the souls of men.” I am confident that it is essentially true in all its statements; that nothing has been set down in malice, nothing exaggerated, nothing drawn from the imagination; that it comes short of the reality, rather than overstates a single fact in regard to <i>slavery as it is</i>.

They do not deny that the slaves are held as property; but that terrible fact seems to convey to their minds no idea of injustice, exposure to outrage, or savage barbarity. Tell them of cruel scourgings, of mutilations and brandings, of scenes of pollution and blood, of the banishment of all light and knowledge, and they affect to be greatly indignant at such enormous exaggerations, such wholesale misstatements, such abominable libels on the character of the southern planters! As if all these direful outrages were not the natural results of slavery! As if it were less cruel to reduce a human being to the condition of a thing, than to give him a severe flagellation, or to deprive him of necessary food and clothing! As if whips, chains, thumb-screws, paddles, blood-hounds, overseers, drivers, patrols, were not all indispensable to keep the slaves down, and to give protection to their ruthless oppressors! As if, when the marriage institution is abolished, concubinage, adultery, and incest, must not necessarily abound; when all the rights of humanity are annihilated, any barrier remains to protect the victim from the fury of the spoiler; when absolute power is assumed over life and liberty, it will not be wielded with destructive sway! Skeptics of this character abound in society. In some few instances, their incredulity arises from a want of reflection; but, generally, it indicates a hatred of the light, a desire to shield slavery from the assaults of its foes, a contempt of the colored race, whether bond or free. Such will try to discredit the shocking tales of slaveholding cruelty which are recorded in this truthful Narrative; but they will labor in vain. <i>Mr. Douglass</i> has frankly disclosed the place of his birth, the names of those who claimed ownership in his body and soul, and the names also of those who committed the crimes which he has alleged against them.

The Baltimore American, of March 17, 1845, relates a similar case of atrocity, perpetrated with similar impunity—as follows:—“<i>Shooting a slave.</i>—We learn, upon the authority of a letter from Charles county, Maryland, received by a gentleman of this city, that a young man, named Matthews, a nephew of General Matthews, and whose father, it is believed, holds an office at Washington, killed one of the slaves upon his father’s farm by shooting him. The letter states that young Matthews had been left in charge of the farm; that he gave an order to the servant, which was disobeyed, when he proceeded to the house, <i>obtained a gun, and, returning, shot the servant.</i> He immediately, the letter continues, fled to his father’s residence, where he still remains unmolested.”—Let it never be forgotten, that no slaveholder or overseer can be convicted of any outrage perpetrated on the person of a slave, however diabolical it may be, on the testimony of colored witnesses, whether bond or free. By the slave code, they are adjudged to be as incompetent to testify against a white man, as though they were indeed a part of the brute creation. Hence, there is no legal protection in fact, whatever there may be in form, for the slave population; and any amount of cruelty may be inflicted on them with impunity. Is it possible for the human mind to conceive of a more horrible state of society?</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000044\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000044\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000045\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000045\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The effect of a religious profession on the conduct of southern masters is vividly described in the following Narrative, and shown to be any thing but salutary.

He was not sure of the exact year of his birth, but he knew that it was 1817 or 1818. As a young boy he was sent to Baltimore, to be a house servant, where he learned to read and write, with the assistance of his master’s wife. In 1838 he escaped from slavery and went to New York City, where he married Anna Murray, a free colored woman whom he had met in Baltimore. Soon thereafter he changed his name to Frederick Douglass. In 1841 he addressed a convention of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in Nantucket and so greatly impressed the group that they immediately employed him as an agent. He was such an impressive orator that numerous persons doubted if he had ever been a slave, so he wrote <i>Narrative Of The Life Of Frederick Douglass</i>. During the Civil War he assisted in the recruiting of colored men for the 54th and 55th Massachusetts Regiments and consistently argued for the emancipation of slaves. After the war he was active in securing and protecting the rights of the freemen. In his later years, at different times, he was secretary of the Santo Domingo Commission, marshall and recorder of deeds of the District of Columbia, and United States Minister to Haiti. His other autobiographical works are <i>My Bondage And My Freedom</i> and <i>Life And Times Of Frederick Douglass</i>, published in 1855 and 1881 respectively. He died in 1895.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000084\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000084\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000085\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000085\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000086\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000086\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a> CHAPTER I</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000087\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000087\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000088\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000088\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday. They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvest-time, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white children could tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it.

My first master’s name was Anthony. I do not remember his first name. He was generally called Captain Anthony—a title which, I presume, he acquired by sailing a craft on the Chesapeake Bay. He was not considered a rich slaveholder. He owned two or three farms, and about thirty slaves. His farms and slaves were under the care of an overseer. The overseer’s name was Plummer. Mr. Plummer was a miserable drunkard, a profane swearer, and a savage monster. He always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel. I have known him to cut and slash the women’s heads so horribly, that even master would be enraged at his cruelty, and would threaten to whip him if he did not mind himself. Master, however, was not a humane slaveholder. It required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an overseer to affect him. He was a cruel man, hardened by a long life of slaveholding. He would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping a slave. I have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most heart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine, whom he used to tie up to a joist, and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered with blood. No words, no tears, no prayers, from his gory victim, seemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose. The louder she screamed, the harder he whipped; and where the blood ran fastest, there he whipped longest. He would whip her to make her scream, and whip her to make her hush; and not until overcome by fatigue, would he cease to swing the blood-clotted cowskin. I remember the first time I ever witnessed this horrible exhibition. I was quite a child, but I well remember it. I never shall forget it whilst I remember any thing. It was the first of a long series of such outrages, of which I was doomed to be a witness and a participant. It struck me with awful force. It was the blood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery, through which I was about to pass. It was a most terrible spectacle.

Had he been a man of pure morals himself, he might have been thought interested in protecting the innocence of my aunt; but those who knew him will not suspect him of any such virtue. Before he commenced whipping Aunt Hester, he took her into the kitchen, and stripped her from neck to waist, leaving her neck, shoulders, and back, entirely naked. He then told her to cross her hands, calling her at the same time a d——d b—-h. After crossing her hands, he tied them with a strong rope, and led her to a stool under a large hook in the joist, put in for the purpose. He made her get upon the stool, and tied her hands to the hook. She now stood fair for his infernal purpose. Her arms were stretched up at their full length, so that she stood upon the ends of her toes. He then said to her, “Now, you d——d b—-h, I’ll learn you how to disobey my orders!” and after rolling up his sleeves, he commenced to lay on the heavy cowskin, and soon the warm, red blood (amid heart-rending shrieks from her, and horrid oaths from him) came dripping to the floor.

They lived in one house, upon the home plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd. My master was Colonel Lloyd’s clerk and superintendent. He was what might be called the overseer of the overseers. I spent two years of childhood on this plantation in my old master’s family. It was here that I witnessed the bloody transaction recorded in the first chapter; and as I received my first impressions of slavery on this plantation, I will give some description of it, and of slavery as it there existed. The plantation is about twelve miles north of Easton, in Talbot county, and is situated on the border of Miles River. The principal products raised upon it were tobacco, corn, and wheat. These were raised in great abundance; so that, with the products of this and the other farms belonging to him, he was able to keep in almost constant employment a large sloop, in carrying them to market at Baltimore. This sloop was named Sally Lloyd, in honor of one of the colonel’s daughters. My master’s son-in-law, Captain Auld, was master of the vessel; she was otherwise manned by the colonel’s own slaves. Their names were Peter, Isaac, Rich, and Jake. These were esteemed very highly by the other slaves, and looked upon as the privileged ones of the plantation; for it was no small affair, in the eyes of the slaves, to be allowed to see Baltimore.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000112\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000112\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000113\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000113\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Colonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation, and owned a large number more on the neighboring farms belonging to him.

The overseers of these, and all the rest of the farms, numbering over twenty, received advice and direction from the managers of the home plantation. This was the great business place. It was the seat of government for the whole twenty farms. All disputes among the overseers were settled here. If a slave was convicted of any high misdemeanor, became unmanageable, or evinced a determination to run away, he was brought immediately here, severely whipped, put on board the sloop, carried to Baltimore, and sold to Austin Woolfolk, or some other slave-trader, as a warning to the slaves remaining.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000114\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000114\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000115\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000115\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Here, too, the slaves of all the other farms received their monthly allowance of food, and their yearly clothing.

They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found myself in tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him, in silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul,—and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because “there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000132\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000132\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000133\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000133\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I have often been utterly astonished, since I came to the north, to find persons who could speak of the singing, among slaves, as evidence of their contentment and happiness.

I have often sung to drown my sorrow, but seldom to express my happiness. Crying for joy, and singing for joy, were alike uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery. The singing of a man cast away upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered as evidence of contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave; the songs of the one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000134\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000134\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000135\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000135\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000136\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000136\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a> CHAPTER III</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000137\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000137\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000138\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000138\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Colonel Lloyd kept a large and finely cultivated garden, which afforded almost constant employment for four men, besides the chief gardener, (Mr. M’Durmond.) This garden was probably the greatest attraction of the place. During the summer months, people came from far and near—from Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolis—to see it. It abounded in fruits of almost every description, from the hardy apple of the north to the delicate orange of the south. This garden was not the least source of trouble on the plantation. Its excellent fruit was quite a temptation to the hungry swarms of boys, as well as the older slaves, belonging to the colonel, few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it. Scarcely a day passed, during the summer, but that some slave had to take the lash for stealing fruit. The colonel had to resort to all kinds of stratagems to keep his slaves out of the garden. The last and most successful one was that of tarring his fence all around; after which, if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person, it was deemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden, or had tried to get in. In either case, he was severely whipped by the chief gardener. This plan worked well; the slaves became as fearful of tar as of the lash. They seemed to realize the impossibility of touching <i>tar</i> without being defiled.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000139\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000139\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000140\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000140\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The colonel also kept a splendid riding equipage.

To attend to this establishment was their sole work. But it was by no means an easy employment; for in nothing was Colonel Lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses. The slightest inattention to these was unpardonable, and was visited upon those, under whose care they were placed, with the severest punishment; no excuse could shield them, if the colonel only suspected any want of attention to his horses—a supposition which he frequently indulged, and one which, of course, made the office of old and young Barney a very trying one. They never knew when they were safe from punishment. They were frequently whipped when least deserving, and escaped whipping when most deserving it. Every thing depended upon the looks of the horses, and the state of Colonel Lloyd’s own mind when his horses were brought to him for use. If a horse did not move fast enough, or hold his head high enough, it was owing to some fault of his keepers. It was painful to stand near the stable-door, and hear the various complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for use. “This horse has not had proper attention. He has not been sufficiently rubbed and curried, or he has not been properly fed; his food was too wet or too dry; he got it too soon or too late; he was too hot or too cold; he had too much hay, and not enough of grain; or he had too much grain, and not enough of hay; instead of old Barney’s attending to the horse, he had very improperly left it to his son.” To all these complaints, no matter how unjust, the slave must answer never a word. Colonel Lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave. When he spoke, a slave must stand, listen, and tremble; and such was literally the case. I have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney, a man between fifty and sixty years of age, uncover his bald head, kneel down upon the cold, damp ground, and receive upon his naked and toil-worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time. Colonel Lloyd had three sons—Edward, Murray, and Daniel,—and three sons-in-law, Mr. Winder, Mr. Nicholson, and Mr. Lowndes. All of these lived at the Great House Farm, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased, from old Barney down to William Wilkes, the coach-driver. I have seen Winder make one of the house-servants stand off from him a suitable distance to be touched with the end of his whip, and at every stroke raise great ridges upon his back.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000143\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000143\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000144\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000144\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>To describe the wealth of Colonel Lloyd would be almost equal to describing the riches of Job.

The slaveholders have been known to send in spies among their slaves, to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition. The frequency of this has had the effect to establish among the slaves the maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head. They suppress the truth rather than take the consequences of telling it, and in so doing prove themselves a part of the human family. If they have any thing to say of their masters, it is generally in their masters’ favor, especially when speaking to an untried man. I have been frequently asked, when a slave, if I had a kind master, and do not remember ever to have given a negative answer; nor did I, in pursuing this course, consider myself as uttering what was absolutely false; for I always measured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up among slaveholders around us. Moreover, slaves are like other people, and imbibe prejudices quite common to others. They think their own better than that of others. Many, under the influence of this prejudice, think their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves; and this, too, in some cases, when the very reverse is true. Indeed, it is not uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative goodness of their masters, each contending for the superior goodness of his own over that of the others. At the very same time, they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately. It was so on our plantation. When Colonel Lloyd’s slaves met the slaves of Jacob Jepson, they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters; Colonel Lloyd’s slaves contending that he was the richest, and Mr. Jepson’s slaves that he was the smartest, and most of a man. Colonel Lloyd’s slaves would boast his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson. Mr. Jepson’s slaves would boast his ability to whip Colonel Lloyd.

It afforded scope for the full exercise of all his powers, and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it. He was one of those who could torture the slightest look, word, or gesture, on the part of the slave, into impudence, and would treat it accordingly. There must be no answering back to him; no explanation was allowed a slave, showing himself to have been wrongfully accused. Mr. Gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders,—“It is better that a dozen slaves should suffer under the lash, than that the overseer should be convicted, in the presence of the slaves, of having been at fault.” No matter how innocent a slave might be—it availed him nothing, when accused by Mr. Gore of any misdemeanor. To be accused was to be convicted, and to be convicted was to be punished; the one always following the other with immutable certainty. To escape punishment was to escape accusation; and few slaves had the fortune to do either, under the overseership of Mr. Gore. He was just proud enough to demand the most debasing homage of the slave, and quite servile enough to crouch, himself, at the feet of the master. He was ambitious enough to be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers, and persevering enough to reach the height of his ambition. He was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment, artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience. He was, of all the overseers, the most dreaded by the slaves. His presence was painful; his eye flashed confusion; and seldom was his sharp, shrill voice heard, without producing horror and trembling in their ranks.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000156\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000156\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000157\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000157\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Mr. Gore was a grave man, and, though a young man, he indulged in no jokes, said no funny words, seldom smiled.

His reply was, (as well as I can remember,) that Demby had become unmanageable. He was setting a dangerous example to the other slaves,—one which, if suffered to pass without some such demonstration on his part, would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and order upon the plantation. He argued that if one slave refused to be corrected, and escaped with his life, the other slaves would soon copy the example; the result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves, and the enslavement of the whites. Mr. Gore’s defence was satisfactory. He was continued in his station as overseer upon the home plantation. His fame as an overseer went abroad. His horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation. It was committed in the presence of slaves, and they of course could neither institute a suit, nor testify against him; and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, and uncensured by the community in which he lives. Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael’s, Talbot county, Maryland, when I left there; and if he is still alive, he very probably lives there now; and if so, he is now, as he was then, as highly esteemed and as much respected as though his guilty soul had not been stained with his brother’s blood.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000162\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000162\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000163\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000163\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I speak advisedly when I say this,—that killing a slave, or any colored person, in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either by the courts or the community.

She was immediately buried, but had not been in her untimely grave but a few hours before she was taken up and examined by the coroner, who decided that she had come to her death by severe beating. The offence for which this girl was thus murdered was this:—She had been set that night to mind Mrs. Hicks’s baby, and during the night she fell asleep, and the baby cried. She, having lost her rest for several nights previous, did not hear the crying. They were both in the room with Mrs. Hicks.

I found no severe trial in my departure. My home was charmless; it was not home to me; on parting from it, I could not feel that I was leaving any thing which I could have enjoyed by staying. My mother was dead, my grandmother lived far off, so that I seldom saw her. I had two sisters and one brother, that lived in the same house with me; but the early separation of us from our mother had well nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories. I looked for home elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one which I was leaving. If, however, I found in my new home hardship, hunger, whipping, and nakedness, I had the consolation that I should not have escaped any one of them by staying. Having already had more than a taste of them in the house of my old master, and having endured them there, I very naturally inferred my ability to endure them elsewhere, and especially at Baltimore; for I had something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the proverb, that “being hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural death in Ireland.” I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore. Cousin Tom, though not fluent in speech, had inspired me with that desire by his eloquent description of the place. I could never point out any thing at the Great House, no matter how beautiful or powerful, but that he had seen something at Baltimore far exceeding, both in beauty and strength, the object which I pointed out to him. Even the Great House itself, with all its pictures, was far inferior to many buildings in Baltimore. So strong was my desire, that I thought a gratification of it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should sustain by the exchange. I left without a regret, and with the highest hopes of future happiness.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000187\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000187\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000188\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000188\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>We sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning.

It is possible, and even quite probable, that but for the mere circumstance of being removed from that plantation to Baltimore, I should have to-day, instead of being here seated by my own table, in the enjoyment of freedom and the happiness of home, writing this Narrative, been confined in the galling chains of slavery. Going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation, and opened the gateway, to all my subsequent prosperity. I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has ever since attended me, and marked my life with so many favors. I regarded the selection of myself as being somewhat remarkable. There were a number of slave children that might have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore. There were those younger, those older, and those of the same age. I was chosen from among them all, and was the first, last, and only choice.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000197\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000197\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000198\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000198\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I may be deemed superstitious, and even egotistical, in regarding this event as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor.

The crouching servility, usually so acceptable a quality in a slave, did not answer when manifested toward her. Her favor was not gained by it; she seemed to be disturbed by it. She did not deem it impudent or unmannerly for a slave to look her in the face. The meanest slave was put fully at ease in her presence, and none left without feeling better for having seen her.

After I had learned this, she assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters. Just at this point of my progress, Mr. Auld found out what was going on, and at once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct me further, telling her, among other things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a slave to read. To use his own words, further, he said, “If you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know nothing but to obey his master—to do as he is told to do. Learning would <i>spoil</i> the best nigger in the world. Now,” said he, “if you teach that nigger (speaking of myself) how to read, there would be no keeping him. It would forever unfit him to be a slave. He would at once become unmanageable, and of no value to his master. As to himself, it could do him no good, but a great deal of harm. It would make him discontented and unhappy.” These words sank deep into my heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering, and called into existence an entirely new train of thought. It was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things, with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in vain. I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty—to wit, the white man’s power to enslave the black man. It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom. It was just what I wanted, and I got it at a time when I the least expected it. Whilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind mistress, I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which, by the merest accident, I had gained from my master. Though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read. The very decided manner with which he spoke, and strove to impress his wife with the evil consequences of giving me instruction, served to convince me that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering. It gave me the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which, he said, would flow from teaching me to read. What he most dreaded, that I most desired. What he most loved, that I most hated. That which to him was a great evil, to be carefully shunned, was to me a great good, to be diligently sought; and the argument which he so warmly urged, against my learning to read, only served to inspire me with a desire and determination to learn. In learning to read, I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly aid of my mistress. I acknowledge the benefit of both.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000208\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000208\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000209\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000209\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I had resided but a short time in Baltimore before I observed a marked difference, in the treatment of slaves, from that which I had witnessed in the country. A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave on the plantation. He is much better fed and clothed, and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation. There is a vestige of decency, a sense of shame, that does much to curb and check those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the plantation. He is a desperate slaveholder, who will shock the humanity of his non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated slave. Few are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputation of being a cruel master; and above all things, they would not be known as not giving a slave enough to eat. Every city slaveholder is anxious to have it known of him, that he feeds his slaves well; and it is due to them to say, that most of them do give their slaves enough to eat. There are, however, some painful exceptions to this rule. Directly opposite to us, on Philpot Street, lived Mr. Thomas Hamilton. He owned two slaves. Their names were Henrietta and Mary. Henrietta was about twenty-two years of age, Mary was about fourteen; and of all the mangled and emaciated creatures I ever looked upon, these two were the most so. His heart must be harder than stone, that could look upon these unmoved. The head, neck, and shoulders of Mary were literally cut to pieces. I have frequently felt her head, and found it nearly covered with festering sores, caused by the lash of her cruel mistress. I do not know that her master ever whipped her, but I have been an eye-witness to the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton. I used to be in Mr. Hamilton’s house nearly every day. Mrs. Hamilton used to sit in a large chair in the middle of the room, with a heavy cowskin always by her side, and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the blood of one of these slaves. The girls seldom passed her without her saying, “Move faster, you <i>black gip!</i>” at the same time giving them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders, often drawing the blood. She would then say, “Take that, you <i>black gip!</i>” continuing, “If you don’t move faster, I’ll move you!” Added to the cruel lashings to which these slaves were subjected, they were kept nearly half-starved. They seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal. I have seen Mary contending with the pigs for the offal thrown into the street. So much was Mary kicked and cut to pieces, that she was oftener called “<i>pecked</i>” than by her name.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000210\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000210\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000211\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000211\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000212\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000212\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a> CHAPTER VII</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000213\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000213\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000214\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000214\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I lived in Master Hugh’s family about seven years.

In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me. When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me.

She was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he had commanded; she seemed anxious to do better. Nothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper. She seemed to think that here lay the danger. I have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury, and snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension. She was an apt woman; and a little experience soon demonstrated, to her satisfaction, that education and slavery were incompatible with each other.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000217\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000217\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000218\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000218\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>From this time I was most narrowly watched.

As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read. When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;—not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard. I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got to be men. “You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, <i>but I am a slave for life!</i> Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?” These words used to trouble them; they would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which I might be free.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000221\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000221\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000222\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000222\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being <i>a slave for life</i> began to bear heavily upon my heart.

Among much of other interesting matter, I found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave was represented as having run away from his master three times. The dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them, when the slave was retaken the third time. In this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the slave. The slave was made to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master—things which had the desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000223\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000223\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000224\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000224\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the same book, I met with one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic emancipation. These were choice documents to me. I read them over and over again with unabated interest. They gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently flashed through my mind, and died away for want of utterance. The moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder. What I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery, and a powerful vindication of human rights. The reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery; but while they relieved me of one difficulty, they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I was relieved. The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers, who had left their homes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land reduced us to slavery. I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men. As I read and contemplated the subject, behold! that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come, to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish. As I writhed under it, I would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing. It had given me a view of my wretched condition, without the remedy. It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get out. In moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Any thing, no matter what, to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or inanimate. The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was heard in every sound, and seen in every thing. It was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and felt nothing without feeling it. It looked from every star, it smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every storm.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000225\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000225\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000226\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000226\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself dead; and but for the hope of being free, I have no doubt but that I should have killed myself, or done something for which I should have been killed. While in this state of mind, I was eager to hear any one speak of slavery. I was a ready listener. Every little while, I could hear something about the abolitionists. It was some time before I found what the word meant. It was always used in such connections as to make it an interesting word to me. If a slave ran away and succeeded in getting clear, or if a slave killed his master, set fire to a barn, or did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder, it was spoken of as the fruit of <i>abolition.</i> Hearing the word in this connection very often, I set about learning what it meant. The dictionary afforded me little or no help. I found it was “the act of abolishing;” but then I did not know what was to be abolished. Here I was perplexed. I did not dare to ask any one about its meaning, for I was satisfied that it was something they wanted me to know very little about. After a patient waiting, I got one of our city papers, containing an account of the number of petitions from the north, praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and of the slave trade between the States. From this time I understood the words <i>abolition</i> and <i>abolitionist,</i> and always drew near when that word was spoken, expecting to hear something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves. The light broke in upon me by degrees. I went one day down on the wharf of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone, I went, unasked, and helped them. When we had finished, one of them came to me and asked me if I were a slave. I told him I was. He asked, “Are ye a slave for life?” I told him that I was. The good Irishman seemed to be deeply affected by the statement. He said to the other that it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for life. He said it was a shame to hold me. They both advised me to run away to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I should be free. I pretended not to be interested in what they said, and treated them as if I did not understand them; for I feared they might be treacherous. White men have been known to encourage slaves to escape, and then, to get the reward, catch them and return them to their masters. I was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me so; but I nevertheless remembered their advice, and from that time I resolved to run away. I looked forward to a time at which it would be safe for me to escape. I was too young to think of doing so immediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, as I might have occasion to write my own pass. I consoled myself with the hope that I should one day find a good chance. Meanwhile, I would learn to write.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000227\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000227\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000228\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000228\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by being in Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard, and frequently seeing the ship carpenters, after hewing, and getting a piece of timber ready for use, write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was intended. When a piece of timber was intended for the larboard side, it would be marked thus—“L.” When a piece was for the starboard side, it would be marked thus—“S.” A piece for the larboard side forward, would be marked thus—“L. F.” When a piece was for starboard side forward, it would be marked thus—“S. F.” For larboard aft, it would be marked thus—“L. A.” For starboard aft, it would be marked thus—“S. A.” I soon learned the names of these letters, and for what they were intended when placed upon a piece of timber in the ship-yard. I immediately commenced copying them, and in a short time was able to make the four letters named. After that, when I met with any boy who I knew could write, I would tell him I could write as well as he. The next word would be, “I don’t believe you. Let me see you try it.” I would then make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn, and ask him to beat that. In this way I got a good many lessons in writing, which it is quite possible I should never have gotten in any other way. During this time, my copy-book was the board fence, brick wall, and pavement; my pen and ink was a lump of chalk. With these, I learned mainly how to write. I then commenced and continued copying the Italics in Webster’s Spelling Book, until I could make them all without looking on the book. By this time, my little Master Thomas had gone to school, and learned how to write, and had written over a number of copy-books. These had been brought home, and shown to some of our near neighbors, and then laid aside. My mistress used to go to class meeting at the Wilk Street meetinghouse every Monday afternoon, and leave me to take care of the house. When left thus, I used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left in Master Thomas’s copy-book, copying what he had written. I continued to do this until I could write a hand very similar to that of Master Thomas. Thus, after a long, tedious effort for years, I finally succeeded in learning how to write.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000229\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000229\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000230\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000230\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000231\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000231\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a> CHAPTER VIII</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000232\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000232\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000233\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000233\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In a very short time after I went to live at Baltimore, my old master’s youngest son Richard died; and in about three years and six months after his death, my old master, Captain Anthony, died, leaving only his son, Andrew, and daughter, Lucretia, to share his estate. He died while on a visit to see his daughter at Hillsborough. Cut off thus unexpectedly, he left no will as to the disposal of his property. It was therefore necessary to have a valuation of the property, that it might be equally divided between Mrs. Lucretia and Master Andrew.

A single word from the white men was enough—against all our wishes, prayers, and entreaties—to sunder forever the dearest friends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties known to human beings. In addition to the pain of separation, there was the horrid dread of falling into the hands of Master Andrew. He was known to us all as being a most cruel wretch,—a common drunkard, who had, by his reckless mismanagement and profligate dissipation, already wasted a large portion of his father’s property. We all felt that we might as well be sold at once to the Georgia traders, as to pass into his hands; for we knew that that would be our inevitable condition,—a condition held by us all in the utmost horror and dread.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000238\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000238\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000239\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000239\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-slaves.

Now all the property of my old master, slaves included, was in the hands of strangers,—strangers who had had nothing to do with accumulating it. Not a slave was left free. All remained slaves, from the youngest to the oldest.

She had rocked him in infancy, attended him in childhood, served him through life, and at his death wiped from his icy brow the cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. She was nevertheless left a slave—a slave for life—a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their hands she saw her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, divided, like so many sheep, without being gratified with the small privilege of a single word, as to their or her own destiny. And, to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having outlived my old master and all his children, having seen the beginning and end of all of them, and her present owners finding she was of but little value, her frame already racked with the pains of old age, and complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs, they took her to the woods, built her a little hut, put up a little mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to die!

I left Baltimore, and went to live with Master Thomas Auld, at St. Michael’s, in March, 1832. It was now more than seven years since I lived with him in the family of my old master, on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. We of course were now almost entire strangers to each other. He was to me a new master, and I to him a new slave. I was ignorant of his temper and disposition; he was equally so of mine. A very short time, however, brought us into full acquaintance with each other. I was made acquainted with his wife not less than with himself. They were well matched, being equally mean and cruel. I was now, for the first time during a space of more than seven years, made to feel the painful gnawings of hunger—a something which I had not experienced before since I left Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. It went hard enough with me then, when I could look back to no period at which I had enjoyed a sufficiency. It was tenfold harder after living in Master Hugh’s family, where I had always had enough to eat, and of that which was good. I have said Master Thomas was a mean man. He was so. Not to give a slave enough to eat, is regarded as the most aggravated development of meanness even among slaveholders. The rule is, no matter how coarse the food, only let there be enough of it. This is the theory; and in the part of Maryland from which I came, it is the general practice,—though there are many exceptions. Master Thomas gave us enough of neither coarse nor fine food. There were four slaves of us in the kitchen—my sister Eliza, my aunt Priscilla, Henny, and myself; and we were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal per week, and very little else, either in the shape of meat or vegetables. It was not enough for us to subsist upon. We were therefore reduced to the wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors. This we did by begging and stealing, whichever came handy in the time of need, the one being considered as legitimate as the other. A great many times have we poor creatures been nearly perishing with hunger, when food in abundance lay mouldering in the safe and smoke-house, and our pious mistress was aware of the fact; and yet that mistress and her husband would kneel every morning, and pray that God would bless them in basket and store!</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000259\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000259\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000260\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000260\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Bad as all slaveholders are, we seldom meet one destitute of every element of character commanding respect. My master was one of this rare sort. I do not know of one single noble act ever performed by him. The leading trait in his character was meanness; and if there were any other element in his nature, it was made subject to this. He was mean; and, like most other mean men, he lacked the ability to conceal his meanness. Captain Auld was not born a slaveholder. He had been a poor man, master only of a Bay craft. He came into possession of all his slaves by marriage; and of all men, adopted slaveholders are the worst. He was cruel, but cowardly. He commanded without firmness. In the enforcement of his rules, he was at times rigid, and at times lax. At times, he spoke to his slaves with the firmness of Napoleon and the fury of a demon; at other times, he might well be mistaken for an inquirer who had lost his way. He did nothing of himself. He might have passed for a lion, but for his ears. In all things noble which he attempted, his own meanness shone most conspicuous. His airs, words, and actions, were the airs, words, and actions of born slaveholders, and, being assumed, were awkward enough. He was not even a good imitator. He possessed all the disposition to deceive, but wanted the power. Having no resources within himself, he was compelled to be the copyist of many, and being such, he was forever the victim of inconsistency; and of consequence he was an object of contempt, and was held as such even by his slaves. The luxury of having slaves of his own to wait upon him was something new and unprepared for. He was a slaveholder without the ability to hold slaves. He found himself incapable of managing his slaves either by force, fear, or fraud. We seldom called him “master;” we generally called him “Captain Auld,” and were hardly disposed to title him at all. I doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making him appear awkward, and of consequence fretful. Our want of reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly. He wished to have us call him master, but lacked the firmness necessary to command us to do so. His wife used to insist upon our calling him so, but to no purpose. In August, 1832, my master attended a Methodist camp-meeting held in the Bay-side, Talbot county, and there experienced religion. I indulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead him to emancipate his slaves, and that, if he did not do this, it would, at any rate, make him more kind and humane. I was disappointed in both these respects. It neither made him to be humane to his slaves, nor to emancipate them. If it had any effect on his character, it made him more cruel and hateful in all his ways; for I believe him to have been a much worse man after his conversion than before. Prior to his conversion, he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him in his savage barbarity; but after his conversion, he found religious sanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty. He made the greatest pretensions to piety. His house was the house of prayer. He prayed morning, noon, and night. He very soon distinguished himself among his brethren, and was soon made a class-leader and exhorter. His activity in revivals was great, and he proved himself an instrument in the hands of the church in converting many souls. His house was the preachers’ home. They used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up; for while he starved us, he stuffed them. We have had three or four preachers there at a time. The names of those who used to come most frequently while I lived there, were Mr. Storks, Mr. Ewery, Mr. Humphry, and Mr. Hickey. I have also seen Mr. George Cookman at our house. We slaves loved Mr. Cookman. We believed him to be a good man. We thought him instrumental in getting Mr. Samuel Harrison, a very rich slaveholder, to emancipate his slaves; and by some means got the impression that he was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the slaves. When he was at our house, we were sure to be called in to prayers. When the others were there, we were sometimes called in and sometimes not. Mr. Cookman took more notice of us than either of the other ministers. He could not come among us without betraying his sympathy for us, and, stupid as we were, we had the sagacity to see it.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000261\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000261\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000262\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000262\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>While I lived with my master in St. Michael’s, there was a white young man, a Mr. Wilson, who proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the instruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the New Testament.

Her hands were so burnt that she never got the use of them. She could do very little but bear heavy burdens. She was to master a bill of expense; and as he was a mean man, she was a constant offence to him. He seemed desirous of getting the poor girl out of existence. He gave her away once to his sister; but, being a poor gift, she was not disposed to keep her. Finally, my benevolent master, to use his own words, “set her adrift to take care of herself.” Here was a recently-converted man, holding on upon the mother, and at the same time turning out her helpless child, to starve and die!

He found me unsuitable to his purpose. My city life, he said, had had a very pernicious effect upon me. It had almost ruined me for every good purpose, and fitted me for every thing which was bad. One of my greatest faults was that of letting his horse run away, and go down to his father-in-law’s farm, which was about five miles from St. Michael’s. I would then have to go after it. My reason for this kind of carelessness, or carefulness, was, that I could always get something to eat when I went there. Master William Hamilton, my master’s father-in-law, always gave his slaves enough to eat. I never left there hungry, no matter how great the need of my speedy return. Master Thomas at length said he would stand it no longer. I had lived with him nine months, during which time he had given me a number of severe whippings, all to no good purpose. He resolved to put me out, as he said, to be broken; and, for this purpose, he let me for one year to a man named Edward Covey. Mr. Covey was a poor man, a farm-renter. He rented the place upon which he lived, as also the hands with which he tilled it. Mr. Covey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young slaves, and this reputation was of immense value to him. It enabled him to get his farm tilled with much less expense to himself than he could have had it done without such a reputation. Some slaveholders thought it not much loss to allow Mr. Covey to have their slaves one year, for the sake of the training to which they were subjected, without any other compensation. He could hire young help with great ease, in consequence of this reputation. Added to the natural good qualities of Mr. Covey, he was a professor of religion—a pious soul—a member and a class-leader in the Methodist church. All of this added weight to his reputation as a “nigger-breaker.” I was aware of all the facts, having been made acquainted with them by a young man who had lived there. I nevertheless made the change gladly; for I was sure of getting enough to eat, which is not the smallest consideration to a hungry man.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000269\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000269\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000270\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000270\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000271\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000271\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a> CHAPTER X</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000272\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000272\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000273\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000273\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I had left Master Thomas’s house, and went to live with Mr. Covey, on the 1st of January, 1833. I was now, for the first time in my life, a field hand. In my new employment, I found myself even more awkward than a country boy appeared to be in a large city. I had been at my new home but one week before Mr. Covey gave me a very severe whipping, cutting my back, causing the blood to run, and raising ridges on my flesh as large as my little finger. The details of this affair are as follows: Mr. Covey sent me, very early in the morning of one of our coldest days in the month of January, to the woods, to get a load of wood. He gave me a team of unbroken oxen. He told me which was the in-hand ox, and which the off-hand one. He then tied the end of a large rope around the horns of the in-hand ox, and gave me the other end of it, and told me, if the oxen started to run, that I must hold on upon the rope. I had never driven oxen before, and of course I was very awkward. I, however, succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty; but I had got a very few rods into the woods, when the oxen took fright, and started full tilt, carrying the cart against trees, and over stumps, in the most frightful manner. I expected every moment that my brains would be dashed out against the trees. After running thus for a considerable distance, they finally upset the cart, dashing it with great force against a tree, and threw themselves into a dense thicket. How I escaped death, I do not know. There I was, entirely alone, in a thick wood, in a place new to me. My cart was upset and shattered, my oxen were entangled among the young trees, and there was none to help me. After a long spell of effort, I succeeded in getting my cart righted, my oxen disentangled, and again yoked to the cart. I now proceeded with my team to the place where I had, the day before, been chopping wood, and loaded my cart pretty heavily, thinking in this way to tame my oxen. I then proceeded on my way home. I had now consumed one half of the day. I got out of the woods safely, and now felt out of danger. I stopped my oxen to open the woods gate; and just as I did so, before I could get hold of my ox-rope, the oxen again started, rushed through the gate, catching it between the wheel and the body of the cart, tearing it to pieces, and coming within a few inches of crushing me against the gate-post. Thus twice, in one short day, I escaped death by the merest chance. On my return, I told Mr. Covey what had happened, and how it happened. He ordered me to return to the woods again immediately. I did so, and he followed on after me. Just as I got into the woods, he came up and told me to stop my cart, and that he would teach me how to trifle away my time, and break gates. He then went to a large gum-tree, and with his axe cut three large switches, and, after trimming them up neatly with his pocketknife, he ordered me to take off my clothes. I made him no answer, but stood with my clothes on. He repeated his order. I still made him no answer, nor did I move to strip myself. Upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore off my clothes, and lashed me till he had worn out his switches, cutting me so savagely as to leave the marks visible for a long time after. This whipping was the first of a number just like it, and for similar offences.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000274\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000274\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000275\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000275\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I lived with Mr. Covey one year.

He would then come out fresh in the evening, ready to urge us on with his words, example, and frequently with the whip. Mr. Covey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with his hands. He was a hard-working man. He knew by himself just what a man or a boy could do. There was no deceiving him. His work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence; and he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with us. This he did by surprising us. He seldom approached the spot where we were at work openly, if he could do it secretly. He always aimed at taking us by surprise. Such was his cunning, that we used to call him, among ourselves, “the snake.” When we were at work in the cornfield, he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection, and all at once he would rise nearly in our midst, and scream out, “Ha, ha! Come, come! Dash on, dash on!” This being his mode of attack, it was never safe to stop a single minute. His comings were like a thief in the night. He appeared to us as being ever at hand. He was under every tree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every window, on the plantation. He would sometimes mount his horse, as if bound to St. Michael’s, a distance of seven miles, and in half an hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence, watching every motion of the slaves. He would, for this purpose, leave his horse tied up in the woods. Again, he would sometimes walk up to us, and give us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long journey, turn his back upon us, and make as though he was going to the house to get ready; and, before he would get half way thither, he would turn short and crawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and there watch us till the going down of the sun.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000278\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000278\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000279\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000279\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Mr. Covey’s <i>forte</i> consisted in his power to deceive. His life was devoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions. Every thing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion, he made conform to his disposition to deceive. He seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the Almighty. He would make a short prayer in the morning, and a long prayer at night; and, strange as it may seem, few men would at times appear more devotional than he. The exercises of his family devotions were always commenced with singing; and, as he was a very poor singer himself, the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon me. He would read his hymn, and nod at me to commence. I would at times do so; at others, I would not. My non-compliance would almost always produce much confusion. To show himself independent of me, he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner. In this state of mind, he prayed with more than ordinary spirit. Poor man! such was his disposition, and success at deceiving, I do verily believe that he sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief, that he was a sincere worshipper of the most high God; and this, too, at a time when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman slave to commit the sin of adultery. The facts in the case are these: Mr. Covey was a poor man; he was just commencing in life; he was only able to buy one slave; and, shocking as is the fact, he bought her, as he said, for <i>a breeder</i>. This woman was named Caroline. Mr. Covey bought her from Mr. Thomas Lowe, about six miles from St. Michael’s. She was a large, able-bodied woman, about twenty years old. She had already given birth to one child, which proved her to be just what he wanted. After buying her, he hired a married man of Mr. Samuel Harrison, to live with him one year; and him he used to fasten up with her every night! The result was, that, at the end of the year, the miserable woman gave birth to twins. At this result Mr. Covey seemed to be highly pleased, both with the man and the wretched woman. Such was his joy, and that of his wife, that nothing they could do for Caroline during her confinement was too good, or too hard, to be done. The children were regarded as being quite an addition to his wealth.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000280\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000280\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000281\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000281\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>If at any one time of my life more than another, I was made to drink the bitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my stay with Mr. Covey.

The circumstances leading to the change in Mr. Covey’s course toward me form an epoch in my humble history. You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man. On one of the hottest days of the month of August, 1833, Bill Smith, William Hughes, a slave named Eli, and myself, were engaged in fanning wheat. Hughes was clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan. Eli was turning, Smith was feeding, and I was carrying wheat to the fan. The work was simple, requiring strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused to such work, it came very hard. About three o’clock of that day, I broke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violent aching of the head, attended with extreme dizziness; I trembled in every limb. Finding what was coming, I nerved myself up, feeling it would never do to stop work. I stood as long as I could stagger to the hopper with grain. When I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as if held down by an immense weight. The fan of course stopped; every one had his own work to do; and no one could do the work of the other, and have his own go on at the same time.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000292\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000292\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000293\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000293\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Mr. Covey was at the house, about one hundred yards from the treading-yard where we were fanning. On hearing the fan stop, he left immediately, and came to the spot where we were. He hastily inquired what the matter was. Bill answered that I was sick, and there was no one to bring wheat to the fan. I had by this time crawled away under the side of the post and rail-fence by which the yard was enclosed, hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun. He then asked where I was. He was told by one of the hands. He came to the spot, and, after looking at me awhile, asked me what was the matter. I told him as well as I could, for I scarce had strength to speak. He then gave me a savage kick in the side, and told me to get up. I tried to do so, but fell back in the attempt. He gave me another kick, and again told me to rise. I again tried, and succeeded in gaining my feet; but, stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding the fan, I again staggered and fell. While down in this situation, Mr. Covey took up the hickory slat with which Hughes had been striking off the half-bushel measure, and with it gave me a heavy blow upon the head, making a large wound, and the blood ran freely; and with this again told me to get up. I made no effort to comply, having now made up my mind to let him do his worst. In a short time after receiving this blow, my head grew better. Mr. Covey had now left me to my fate. At this moment I resolved, for the first time, to go to my master, enter a complaint, and ask his protection. In order to do this, I must that afternoon walk seven miles; and this, under the circumstances, was truly a severe undertaking. I was exceedingly feeble; made so as much by the kicks and blows which I received, as by the severe fit of sickness to which I had been subjected. I, however, watched my chance, while Covey was looking in an opposite direction, and started for St. Michael’s. I succeeded in getting a considerable distance on my way to the woods, when Covey discovered me, and called after me to come back, threatening what he would do if I did not come. I disregarded both his calls and his threats, and made my way to the woods as fast as my feeble state would allow; and thinking I might be overhauled by him if I kept the road, I walked through the woods, keeping far enough from the road to avoid detection, and near enough to prevent losing my way. I had not gone far before my little strength again failed me. I could go no farther. I fell down, and lay for a considerable time. The blood was yet oozing from the wound on my head. For a time I thought I should bleed to death; and think now that I should have done so, but that the blood so matted my hair as to stop the wound. After lying there about three quarters of an hour, I nerved myself up again, and started on my way, through bogs and briers, barefooted and bareheaded, tearing my feet sometimes at nearly every step; and after a journey of about seven miles, occupying some five hours to perform it, I arrived at master’s store. I then presented an appearance enough to affect any but a heart of iron. From the crown of my head to my feet, I was covered with blood. My hair was all clotted with dust and blood; my shirt was stiff with blood. I suppose I looked like a man who had escaped a den of wild beasts, and barely escaped them. In this state I appeared before my master, humbly entreating him to interpose his authority for my protection. I told him all the circumstances as well as I could, and it seemed, as I spoke, at times to affect him. He would then walk the floor, and seek to justify Covey by saying he expected I deserved it. He asked me what I wanted. I told him, to let me get a new home; that as sure as I lived with Mr. Covey again, I should live with but to die with him; that Covey would surely kill me; he was in a fair way for it. Master Thomas ridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr. Covey’s killing me, and said that he knew Mr. Covey; that he was a good man, and that he could not think of taking me from him; that, should he do so, he would lose the whole year’s wages; that I belonged to Mr. Covey for one year, and that I must go back to him, come what might; and that I must not trouble him with any more stories, or that he would himself <i>get hold of me</i>. After threatening me thus, he gave me a very large dose of salts, telling me that I might remain in St. Michael’s that night, (it being quite late,) but that I must be off back to Mr. Covey’s early in the morning; and that if I did not, he would <i>get hold of me,</i> which meant that he would whip me. I remained all night, and, according to his orders, I started off to Covey’s in the morning, (Saturday morning,) wearied in body and broken in spirit. I got no supper that night, or breakfast that morning. I reached Covey’s about nine o’clock; and just as I was getting over the fence that divided Mrs. Kemp’s fields from ours, out ran Covey with his cowskin, to give me another whipping. Before he could reach me, I succeeded in getting to the cornfield; and as the corn was very high, it afforded me the means of hiding. He seemed very angry, and searched for me a long time. My behavior was altogether unaccountable. He finally gave up the chase, thinking, I suppose, that I must come home for something to eat; he would give himself no further trouble in looking for me. I spent that day mostly in the woods, having the alternative before me,—to go home and be whipped to death, or stay in the woods and be starved to death. That night, I fell in with Sandy Jenkins, a slave with whom I was somewhat acquainted. Sandy had a free wife who lived about four miles from Mr. Covey’s; and it being Saturday, he was on his way to see her. I told him my circumstances, and he very kindly invited me to go home with him. I went home with him, and talked this whole matter over, and got his advice as to what course it was best for me to pursue. I found Sandy an old adviser. He told me, with great solemnity, I must go back to Covey; but that before I went, I must go with him into another part of the woods, where there was a certain <i>root,</i> which, if I would take some of it with me, carrying it <i>always on my right side,</i> would render it impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white man, to whip me. He said he had carried it for years; and since he had done so, he had never received a blow, and never expected to while he carried it. I at first rejected the idea, that the simple carrying of a root in my pocket would have any such effect as he had said, and was not disposed to take it; but Sandy impressed the necessity with much earnestness, telling me it could do no harm, if it did no good. To please him, I at length took the root, and, according to his direction, carried it upon my right side. This was Sunday morning. I immediately started for home; and upon entering the yard gate, out came Mr. Covey on his way to meeting. He spoke to me very kindly, bade me drive the pigs from a lot near by, and passed on towards the church. Now, this singular conduct of Mr. Covey really made me begin to think that there was something in the <i>root</i> which Sandy had given me; and had it been on any other day than Sunday, I could have attributed the conduct to no other cause than the influence of that root; and as it was, I was half inclined to think the <i>root</i> to be something more than I at first had taken it to be. All went well till Monday morning. On this morning, the virtue of the <i>root</i> was fully tested. Long before daylight, I was called to go and rub, curry, and feed, the horses. I obeyed, and was glad to obey. But whilst thus engaged, whilst in the act of throwing down some blades from the loft, Mr. Covey entered the stable with a long rope; and just as I was half out of the loft, he caught hold of my legs, and was about tying me. As soon as I found what he was up to, I gave a sudden spring, and as I did so, he holding to my legs, I was brought sprawling on the stable floor. Mr. Covey seemed now to think he had me, and could do what he pleased; but at this moment—from whence came the spirit I don’t know—I resolved to fight; and, suiting my action to the resolution, I seized Covey hard by the throat; and as I did so, I rose. He held on to me, and I to him. My resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey seemed taken all aback. He trembled like a leaf. This gave me assurance, and I held him uneasy, causing the blood to run where I touched him with the ends of my fingers. Mr. Covey soon called out to Hughes for help. Hughes came, and, while Covey held me, attempted to tie my right hand. While he was in the act of doing so, I watched my chance, and gave him a heavy kick close under the ribs. This kick fairly sickened Hughes, so that he left me in the hands of Mr. Covey. This kick had the effect of not only weakening Hughes, but Covey also. When he saw Hughes bending over with pain, his courage quailed. He asked me if I meant to persist in my resistance. I told him I did, come what might; that he had used me like a brute for six months, and that I was determined to be used so no longer. With that, he strove to drag me to a stick that was lying just out of the stable door. He meant to knock me down. But just as he was leaning over to get the stick, I seized him with both hands by his collar, and brought him by a sudden snatch to the ground. By this time, Bill came. Covey called upon him for assistance. Bill wanted to know what he could do. Covey said, “Take hold of him, take hold of him!” Bill said his master hired him out to work, and not to help to whip me; so he left Covey and myself to fight our own battle out. We were at it for nearly two hours. Covey at length let me go, puffing and blowing at a great rate, saying that if I had not resisted, he would not have whipped me half so much. The truth was, that he had not whipped me at all. I considered him as getting entirely the worst end of the bargain; for he had drawn no blood from me, but I had from him. The whole six months afterwards, that I spent with Mr. Covey, he never laid the weight of his finger upon me in anger. He would occasionally say, he didn’t want to get hold of me again. “No,” thought I, “you need not; for you will come off worse than you did before.”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000294\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000294\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000295\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000295\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>This battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a slave.

The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow, even death itself. He only can understand the deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has himself repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery. I felt as I never felt before. It was a glorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom. My long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance took its place; and I now resolved that, however long I might remain a slave in form, the day had passed forever when I could be a slave in fact.

The days between Christmas and New Year’s day are allowed as holidays; and, accordingly, we were not required to perform any labor, more than to feed and take care of the stock. This time we regarded as our own, by the grace of our masters; and we therefore used or abused it nearly as we pleased. Those of us who had families at a distance, were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society. This time, however, was spent in various ways. The staid, sober, thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn-brooms, mats, horse-collars, and baskets; and another class of us would spend the time in hunting opossums, hares, and coons. But by far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball, wrestling, running foot-races, fiddling, dancing, and drinking whisky; and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters. A slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them. He was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master. It was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas; and he was regarded as lazy indeed, who had not provided himself with the necessary means, during the year, to get whisky enough to last him through Christmas.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000302\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000302\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000303\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000303\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>From what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave, I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection.

They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the result of selfishness, and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the down-trodden slave. They do not give the slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during its continuance, but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it. This will be seen by the fact, that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their ending as of their beginning. Their object seems to be, to disgust their slaves with freedom, by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation. For instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him drunk. One plan is, to make bets on their slaves, as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk; and in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess. Thus, when the slave asks for virtuous freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his ignorance, cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labelled with the name of liberty. The most of us used to drink it down, and the result was just what might be supposed; many of us were led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery. We felt, and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum. So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field,—feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000306\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000306\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000307\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000307\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of fraud and inhumanity of slavery. It is so. The mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom, by allowing him to see only the abuse of it, is carried out in other things. For instance, a slave loves molasses; he steals some. His master, in many cases, goes off to town, and buys a large quantity; he returns, takes his whip, and commands the slave to eat the molasses, until the poor fellow is made sick at the very mention of it. The same mode is sometimes adopted to make the slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance. A slave runs through his allowance, and applies for more. His master is enraged at him; but, not willing to send him off without food, gives him more than is necessary, and compels him to eat it within a given time. Then, if he complains that he cannot eat it, he is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting, and is whipped for being hard to please! I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same principle, drawn from my own observation, but think the cases I have cited sufficient.

I soon found Mr. Freeland a very different man from Mr. Covey. Though not rich, he was what would be called an educated southern gentleman. Mr. Covey, as I have shown, was a well-trained negro-breaker and slave-driver. The former (slaveholder though he was) seemed to possess some regard for honor, some reverence for justice, and some respect for humanity. The latter seemed totally insensible to all such sentiments. Mr. Freeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders, such as being very passionate and fretful; but I must do him the justice to say, that he was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which Mr. Covey was constantly addicted. The one was open and frank, and we always knew where to find him. The other was a most artful deceiver, and could be understood only by such as were skilful enough to detect his cunningly-devised frauds. Another advantage I gained in my new master was, he made no pretensions to, or profession of, religion; and this, in my opinion, was truly a great advantage. I assert most unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes,—a justifier of the most appalling barbarity,—a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds,—and a dark shelter under, which the darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection. Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, next to that enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me. For of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others. It was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder, but to live in a community of such religionists. Very near Mr. Freeland lived the Rev. Daniel Weeden, and in the same neighborhood lived the Rev. Rigby Hopkins. These were members and ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church.

His chief boast was his ability to manage slaves. The peculiar feature of his government was that of whipping slaves in advance of deserving it. He always managed to have one or more of his slaves to whip every Monday morning. He did this to alarm their fears, and strike terror into those who escaped. His plan was to whip for the smallest offences, to prevent the commission of large ones. Mr. Hopkins could always find some excuse for whipping a slave. It would astonish one, unaccustomed to a slaveholding life, to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can find things, of which to make occasion to whip a slave. A mere look, word, or motion,—a mistake, accident, or want of power,—are all matters for which a slave may be whipped at any time. Does a slave look dissatisfied? It is said, he has the devil in him, and it must be whipped out. Does he speak loudly when spoken to by his master? Then he is getting high-minded, and should be taken down a button-hole lower. Does he forget to pull off his hat at the approach of a white person? Then he is wanting in reverence, and should be whipped for it. Does he ever venture to vindicate his conduct, when censured for it? Then he is guilty of impudence,—one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty. Does he ever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from that pointed out by his master? He is indeed presumptuous, and getting above himself; and nothing less than a flogging will do for him. Does he, while ploughing, break a plough,—or, while hoeing, break a hoe? It is owing to his carelessness, and for it a slave must always be whipped. Mr. Hopkins could always find something of this sort to justify the use of the lash, and he seldom failed to embrace such opportunities. There was not a man in the whole county, with whom the slaves who had the getting their own home, would not prefer to live, rather than with this Rev. Mr. Hopkins. And yet there was not a man any where round, who made higher professions of religion, or was more active in revivals,—more attentive to the class, love-feast, prayer and preaching meetings, or more devotional in his family,—that prayed earlier, later, louder, and longer,—than this same reverend slave-driver, Rigby Hopkins.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000312\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000312\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000313\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000313\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>But to return to Mr. Freeland, and to my experience while in his employment.

It was necessary to keep our religious masters at St. Michael’s unacquainted with the fact, that, instead of spending the Sabbath in wrestling, boxing, and drinking whisky, we were trying to learn how to read the will of God; for they had much rather see us engaged in those degrading sports, than to see us behaving like intellectual, moral, and accountable beings. My blood boils as I think of the bloody manner in which Messrs.

When I think that these precious souls are to-day shut up in the prison-house of slavery, my feelings overcome me, and I am almost ready to ask, “Does a righteous God govern the universe? and for what does he hold the thunders in his right hand, if not to smite the oppressor, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler?” These dear souls came not to Sabbath school because it was popular to do so, nor did I teach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged. Every moment they spent in that school, they were liable to be taken up, and given thirty-nine lashes. They came because they wished to learn. Their minds had been starved by their cruel masters. They had been shut up in mental darkness. I taught them, because it was the delight of my soul to be doing something that looked like bettering the condition of my race. I kept up my school nearly the whole year I lived with Mr. Freeland; and, beside my Sabbath school, I devoted three evenings in the week, during the winter, to teaching the slaves at home.

But, by this time, I began to want to live <i>upon free land</i> as well as <i>with Freeland;</i> and I was no longer content, therefore, to live with him or any other slaveholder. I began, with the commencement of the year, to prepare myself for a final struggle, which should decide my fate one way or the other. My tendency was upward. I was fast approaching manhood, and year after year had passed, and I was still a slave. These thoughts roused me—I must do something. I therefore resolved that 1835 should not pass without witnessing an attempt, on my part, to secure my liberty. But I was not willing to cherish this determination alone. My fellow-slaves were dear to me. I was anxious to have them participate with me in this, my life-giving determination. I therefore, though with great prudence, commenced early to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition, and to imbue their minds with thoughts of freedom. I bent myself to devising ways and means for our escape, and meanwhile strove, on all fitting occasions, to impress them with the gross fraud and inhumanity of slavery. I went first to Henry, next to John, then to the others. I found, in them all, warm hearts and noble spirits. They were ready to hear, and ready to act when a feasible plan should be proposed. This was what I wanted. I talked to them of our want of manhood, if we submitted to our enslavement without at least one noble effort to be free. We met often, and consulted frequently, and told our hopes and fears, recounted the difficulties, real and imagined, which we should be called on to meet. At times we were almost disposed to give up, and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot; at others, we were firm and unbending in our determination to go. Whenever we suggested any plan, there was shrinking—the odds were fearful. Our path was beset with the greatest obstacles; and if we succeeded in gaining the end of it, our right to be free was yet questionable—we were yet liable to be returned to bondage. We could see no spot, this side of the ocean, where we could be free. We knew nothing about Canada. Our knowledge of the north did not extend farther than New York; and to go there, and be forever harassed with the frightful liability of being returned to slavery—with the certainty of being treated tenfold worse than before—the thought was truly a horrible one, and one which it was not easy to overcome. The case sometimes stood thus: At every gate through which we were to pass, we saw a watchman—at every ferry a guard—on every bridge a sentinel—and in every wood a patrol. We were hemmed in upon every side. Here were the difficulties, real or imagined—the good to be sought, and the evil to be shunned. On the one hand, there stood slavery, a stern reality, glaring frightfully upon us,—its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions, and even now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh. On the other hand, away back in the dim distance, under the flickering light of the north star, behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain, stood a doubtful freedom—half frozen—beckoning us to come and share its hospitality. This in itself was sometimes enough to stagger us; but when we permitted ourselves to survey the road, we were frequently appalled. Upon either side we saw grim death, assuming the most horrid shapes. Now it was starvation, causing us to eat our own flesh;—now we were contending with the waves, and were drowned;—now we were overtaken, and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound. We were stung by scorpions, chased by wild beasts, bitten by snakes, and finally, after having nearly reached the desired spot,—after swimming rivers, encountering wild beasts, sleeping in the woods, suffering hunger and nakedness,—we were overtaken by our pursuers, and, in our resistance, we were shot dead upon the spot!

The white men were on horseback, and the colored ones were walking behind, as if tied. I watched them a few moments till they got up to our lane gate. Here they halted, and tied the colored men to the gate-post. I was not yet certain as to what the matter was. In a few moments, in rode Mr. Hamilton, with a speed betokening great excitement.

Mr. Freeland put his head in at the door, and called me by name, saying, there were some gentlemen at the door who wished to see me. I stepped to the door, and inquired what they wanted. They at once seized me, and, without giving me any satisfaction, tied me—lashing my hands closely together. I insisted upon knowing what the matter was.

With this, two of the constables pulled out their shining pistols, and swore, by their Creator, that they would make him cross his hands or kill him. Each cocked his pistol, and, with fingers on the trigger, walked up to Henry, saying, at the same time, if he did not cross his hands, they would blow his damned heart out. “Shoot me, shoot me!” said Henry; “you can’t kill me but once. Shoot, shoot,—and be damned! <i>I won’t be tied!</i>” This he said in a tone of loud defiance; and at the same time, with a motion as quick as lightning, he with one single stroke dashed the pistols from the hand of each constable. As he did this, all hands fell upon him, and, after beating him some time, they finally overpowered him, and got him tied.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000350\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000350\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000351\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000351\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>During the scuffle, I managed, I know not how, to get my pass out, and, without being discovered, put it into the fire.

Henry nor John would never have thought of such a thing.” I made no reply, and was immediately hurried off towards St. Michael’s. Just a moment previous to the scuffle with Henry, Mr. Hamilton suggested the propriety of making a search for the protections which he had understood Frederick had written for himself and the rest. But, just at the moment he was about carrying his proposal into effect, his aid was needed in helping to tie Henry; and the excitement attending the scuffle caused them either to forget, or to deem it unsafe, under the circumstances, to search.

We were sent off to the jail at Easton. When we got there, we were delivered up to the sheriff, Mr. Joseph Graham, and by him placed in jail.

It is due to the noble Henry to say, he seemed almost as reluctant at leaving the prison as at leaving home to come to the prison.

I was put there to learn how to calk. It, however, proved a very unfavorable place for the accomplishment of this object. Mr. Gardner was engaged that spring in building two large man-of-war brigs, professedly for the Mexican government. The vessels were to be launched in the July of that year, and in failure thereof, Mr. Gardner was to lose a considerable sum; so that when I entered, all was hurry. There was no time to learn any thing. Every man had to do that which he knew how to do. In entering the shipyard, my orders from Mr. Gardner were, to do whatever the carpenters commanded me to do. This was placing me at the beck and call of about seventy-five men. I was to regard all these as masters. Their word was to be my law. My situation was a most trying one. At times I needed a dozen pair of hands. I was called a dozen ways in the space of a single minute. Three or four voices would strike my ear at the same moment. It was—“Fred., come help me to cant this timber here.”—“Fred., come carry this timber yonder.”—“Fred., bring that roller here.”—“Fred., go get a fresh can of water.”—“Fred., come help saw off the end of this timber.”—“Fred., go quick, and get the crowbar.”—“Fred., hold on the end of this fall.”—“Fred., go to the blacksmith’s shop, and get a new punch.”—“Hurra, Fred! run and bring me a cold chisel.”—“I say, Fred., bear a hand, and get up a fire as quick as lightning under that steam-box.”—“Halloo, nigger! come, turn this grindstone.”—“Come, come! move, move! and <i>bowse</i> this timber forward.”—“I say, darky, blast your eyes, why don’t you heat up some pitch?”—“Halloo! halloo! halloo!” (Three voices at the same time.) “Come here!—Go there!—Hold on where you are!

The facts in the case were these: Until a very little while after I went there, white and black ship-carpenters worked side by side, and no one seemed to see any impropriety in it. All hands seemed to be very well satisfied. Many of the black carpenters were freemen. Things seemed to be going on very well. All at once, the white carpenters knocked off, and said they would not work with free colored workmen. Their reason for this, as alleged, was, that if free colored carpenters were encouraged, they would soon take the trade into their own hands, and poor white men would be thrown out of employment. They therefore felt called upon at once to put a stop to it. And, taking advantage of Mr. Gardner’s necessities, they broke off, swearing they would work no longer, unless he would discharge his black carpenters. Now, though this did not extend to me in form, it did reach me in fact. My fellow-apprentices very soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me. They began to put on airs, and talk about the “niggers” taking the country, saying we all ought to be killed; and, being encouraged by the journeymen, they commenced making my condition as hard as they could, by hectoring me around, and sometimes striking me. I, of course, kept the vow I made after the fight with Mr. Covey, and struck back again, regardless of consequences; and while I kept them from combining, I succeeded very well; for I could whip the whole of them, taking them separately. They, however, at length combined, and came upon me, armed with sticks, stones, and heavy handspikes. One came in front with a half brick. There was one at each side of me, and one behind me. While I was attending to those in front, and on either side, the one behind ran up with the handspike, and struck me a heavy blow upon the head. It stunned me. I fell, and with this they all ran upon me, and fell to beating me with their fists. I let them lay on for a while, gathering strength. In an instant, I gave a sudden surge, and rose to my hands and knees. Just as I did that, one of their number gave me, with his heavy boot, a powerful kick in the left eye. My eyeball seemed to have burst. When they saw my eye closed, and badly swollen, they left me. With this I seized the handspike, and for a time pursued them. But here the carpenters interfered, and I thought I might as well give it up. It was impossible to stand my hand against so many. All this took place in sight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters, and not one interposed a friendly word; but some cried, “Kill the damned nigger! Kill him! kill him! He struck a white person.” I found my only chance for life was in flight. I succeeded in getting away without an additional blow, and barely so; for to strike a white man is death by Lynch law,—and that was the law in Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard; nor is there much of any other out of Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000366\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000366\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000367\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000367\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I went directly home, and told the story of my wrongs to Master Hugh; and I am happy to say of him, irreligious as he was, his conduct was heavenly, compared with that of his brother Thomas under similar circumstances. He listened attentively to my narration of the circumstances leading to the savage outrage, and gave many proofs of his strong indignation at it. The heart of my once overkind mistress was again melted into pity. My puffed-out eye and blood-covered face moved her to tears. She took a chair by me, washed the blood from my face, and, with a mother’s tenderness, bound up my head, covering the wounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef. It was almost compensation for my suffering to witness, once more, a manifestation of kindness from this, my once affectionate old mistress. Master Hugh was very much enraged. He gave expression to his feelings by pouring out curses upon the heads of those who did the deed. As soon as I got a little the better of my bruises, he took me with him to Esquire Watson’s, on Bond Street, to see what could be done about the matter. Mr. Watson inquired who saw the assault committed. Master Hugh told him it was done in Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard at midday, where there were a large company of men at work. “As to that,” he said, “the deed was done, and there was no question as to who did it.” His answer was, he could do nothing in the case, unless some white man would come forward and testify. He could issue no warrant on my word. If I had been killed in the presence of a thousand colored people, their testimony combined would have been insufficient to have arrested one of the murderers. Master Hugh, for once, was compelled to say this state of things was too bad. Of course, it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his testimony in my behalf, and against the white young men. Even those who may have sympathized with me were not prepared to do this. It required a degree of courage unknown to them to do so; for just at that time, the slightest manifestation of humanity toward a colored person was denounced as abolitionism, and that name subjected its bearer to frightful liabilities. The watchwords of the bloody-minded in that region, and in those days, were, “Damn the abolitionists!” and “Damn the niggers!” There was nothing done, and probably nothing would have been done if I had been killed. Such was, and such remains, the state of things in the Christian city of Baltimore.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000368\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000368\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000369\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000369\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Master Hugh, finding he could get no redress, refused to let me go back again to Mr. Gardner. He kept me himself, and his wife dressed my wound till I was again restored to health. He then took me into the ship-yard of which he was foreman, in the employment of Mr. Walter Price. There I was immediately set to calking, and very soon learned the art of using my mallet and irons. In the course of one year from the time I left Mr. Gardner’s, I was able to command the highest wages given to the most experienced calkers. I was now of some importance to my master. I was bringing him from six to seven dollars per week. I sometimes brought him nine dollars per week: my wages were a dollar and a half a day. After learning how to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own contracts, and collected the money which I earned. My pathway became much more smooth than before; my condition was now much more comfortable. When I could get no calking to do, I did nothing. During these leisure times, those old notions about freedom would steal over me again. When in Mr. Gardner’s employment, I was kept in such a perpetual whirl of excitement, I could think of nothing, scarcely, but my life; and in thinking of my life, I almost forgot my liberty. I have observed this in my experience of slavery,—that whenever my condition was improved, instead of its increasing my contentment, it only increased my desire to be free, and set me to thinking of plans to gain my freedom. I have found that, to make a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the power of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery; he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought to that only when he ceases to be a man.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000370\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000370\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000371\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000371\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day.

Secondly, such a statement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part of slaveholders than has existed heretofore among them; which would, of course, be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape his galling chains. I deeply regret the necessity that impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my experience in slavery. It would afford me great pleasure indeed, as well as materially add to the interest of my narrative, were I at liberty to gratify a curiosity, which I know exists in the minds of many, by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my most fortunate escape. But I must deprive myself of this pleasure, and the curious of the gratification which such a statement would afford. I would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which evil-minded men might suggest, rather than exculpate myself, and thereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a brother slave might clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000377\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000377\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000378\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000378\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I have never approved of the very public manner in which some of our western friends have conducted what they call the <i>underground railroad,</i> but which I think, by their open declarations, has been made most emphatically the <i>upperground railroad.</i> I honor those good men and women for their noble daring, and applaud them for willingly subjecting themselves to bloody persecution, by openly avowing their participation in the escape of slaves. I, however, can see very little good resulting from such a course, either to themselves or the slaves escaping; while, upon the other hand, I see and feel assured that those open declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining, who are seeking to escape. They do nothing towards enlightening the slave, whilst they do much towards enlightening the master. They stimulate him to greater watchfulness, and enhance his power to capture his slave. We owe something to the slave south of the line as well as to those north of it; and in aiding the latter on their way to freedom, we should be careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the former from escaping from slavery. I would keep the merciless slaveholder profoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave. I would leave him to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors, ever ready to snatch from his infernal grasp his trembling prey. Let him be left to feel his way in the dark; let darkness commensurate with his crime hover over him; and let him feel that at every step he takes, in pursuit of the flying bondman, he is running the frightful risk of having his hot brains dashed out by an invisible agency. Let us render the tyrant no aid; let us not hold the light by which he can trace the footprints of our flying brother. But enough of this.

I could see no reason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my toil into the purse of my master. When I carried to him my weekly wages, he would, after counting the money, look me in the face with a robber-like fierceness, and ask, “Is this all?” He was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent. He would, however, when I made him six dollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourage me. It had the opposite effect. I regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole. The fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof, to my mind, that he believed me entitled to the whole of them. I always felt worse for having received any thing; for I feared that the giving me a few cents would ease his conscience, and make him feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort of robber. My discontent grew upon me. I was ever on the look-out for means of escape; and, finding no direct means, I determined to try to hire my time, with a view of getting money with which to make my escape. In the spring of 1838, when Master Thomas came to Baltimore to purchase his spring goods, I got an opportunity, and applied to him to allow me to hire my time. He unhesitatingly refused my request, and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape. He told me I could go nowhere but that he could get me; and that, in the event of my running away, he should spare no pains in his efforts to catch me. He exhorted me to content myself, and be obedient. He told me, if I would be happy, I must lay out no plans for the future. He said, if I behaved myself properly, he would take care of me. Indeed, he advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future, and taught me to depend solely upon him for happiness. He seemed to see fully the pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature, in order to contentment in slavery. But in spite of him, and even in spite of myself, I continued to think, and to think about the injustice of my enslavement, and the means of escape.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000381\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000381\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000382\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000382\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>About two months after this, I applied to Master Hugh for the privilege of hiring my time. He was not acquainted with the fact that I had applied to Master Thomas, and had been refused. He too, at first, seemed disposed to refuse; but, after some reflection, he granted me the privilege, and proposed the following terms: I was to be allowed all my time, make all contracts with those for whom I worked, and find my own employment; and, in return for this liberty, I was to pay him three dollars at the end of each week; find myself in calking tools, and in board and clothing. My board was two dollars and a half per week. This, with the wear and tear of clothing and calking tools, made my regular expenses about six dollars per week. This amount I was compelled to make up, or relinquish the privilege of hiring my time. Rain or shine, work or no work, at the end of each week the money must be forthcoming, or I must give up my privilege. This arrangement, it will be perceived, was decidedly in my master’s favor. It relieved him of all need of looking after me. His money was sure. He received all the benefits of slaveholding without its evils; while I endured all the evils of a slave, and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman. I found it a hard bargain. But, hard as it was, I thought it better than the old mode of getting along. It was a step towards freedom to be allowed to bear the responsibilities of a freeman, and I was determined to hold on upon it. I bent myself to the work of making money. I was ready to work at night as well as day, and by the most untiring perseverance and industry, I made enough to meet my expenses, and lay up a little money every week. I went on thus from May till August. Master Hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer. The ground for his refusal was a failure on my part, one Saturday night, to pay him for my week’s time. This failure was occasioned by my attending a camp meeting about ten miles from Baltimore. During the week, I had entered into an engagement with a number of young friends to start from Baltimore to the camp ground early Saturday evening; and being detained by my employer, I was unable to get down to Master Hugh’s without disappointing the company. I knew that Master Hugh was in no special need of the money that night. I therefore decided to go to camp meeting, and upon my return pay him the three dollars. I staid at the camp meeting one day longer than I intended when I left. But as soon as I returned, I called upon him to pay him what he considered his due. I found him very angry; he could scarce restrain his wrath. He said he had a great mind to give me a severe whipping. He wished to know how I dared go out of the city without asking his permission. I told him I hired my time and while I paid him the price which he asked for it, I did not know that I was bound to ask him when and where I should go. This reply troubled him; and, after reflecting a few moments, he turned to me, and said I should hire my time no longer; that the next thing he should know of, I would be running away. Upon the same plea, he told me to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith. I did so; but instead of seeking work, as I had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time, I spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke of work. I did this in retaliation. Saturday night, he called upon me as usual for my week’s wages. I told him I had no wages; I had done no work that week. Here we were upon the point of coming to blows. He raved, and swore his determination to get hold of me. I did not allow myself a single word; but was resolved, if he laid the weight of his hand upon me, it should be blow for blow. He did not strike me, but told me that he would find me in constant employment in future. I thought the matter over during the next day, Sunday, and finally resolved upon the third day of September, as the day upon which I would make a second attempt to secure my freedom. I now had three weeks during which to prepare for my journey. Early on Monday morning, before Master Hugh had time to make any engagement for me, I went out and got employment of Mr. Butler, at his ship-yard near the drawbridge, upon what is called the City Block, thus making it unnecessary for him to seek employment for me. At the end of the week, I brought him between eight and nine dollars. He seemed very well pleased, and asked why I did not do the same the week before. He little knew what my plans were. My object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent to run away; and in this I succeeded admirably. I suppose he thought I was never better satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which I was planning my escape. The second week passed, and again I carried him my full wages; and so well pleased was he, that he gave me twenty-five cents, (quite a large sum for a slaveholder to give a slave,) and bade me to make a good use of it. I told him I would.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000383\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000383\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000384\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000384\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Things went on without very smoothly indeed, but within there was trouble. It is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of my contemplated start drew near. I had a number of warmhearted friends in Baltimore,—friends that I loved almost as I did my life,—and the thought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond expression. It is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery, who now remain, but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to their friends. The thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most painful thought with which I had to contend. The love of them was my tender point, and shook my decision more than all things else. Besides the pain of separation, the dread and apprehension of a failure exceeded what I had experienced at my first attempt. The appalling defeat I then sustained returned to torment me. I felt assured that, if I failed in this attempt, my case would be a hopeless one—it would seal my fate as a slave forever. I could not hope to get off with any thing less than the severest punishment, and being placed beyond the means of escape. It required no very vivid imagination to depict the most frightful scenes through which I should have to pass, in case I failed. The wretchedness of slavery, and the blessedness of freedom, were perpetually before me. It was life and death with me. But I remained firm, and, according to my resolution, on the third day of September, 1838, I left my chains, and succeeded in reaching New York without the slightest interruption of any kind. How I did so,—what means I adopted,—what direction I travelled, and by what mode of conveyance,—I must leave unexplained, for the reasons before mentioned.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000385\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000385\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000386\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000386\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free State. I have never been able to answer the question with any satisfaction to myself. It was a moment of the highest excitement I ever experienced. I suppose I felt as one may imagine the unarmed mariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendly man-of-war from the pursuit of a pirate. In writing to a dear friend, immediately after my arrival at New York, I said I felt like one who had escaped a den of hungry lions. This state of mind, however, very soon subsided; and I was again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness. I was yet liable to be taken back, and subjected to all the tortures of slavery. This in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm. But the loneliness overcame me. There I was in the midst of thousands, and yet a perfect stranger; without home and without friends, in the midst of thousands of my own brethren—children of a common Father, and yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition. I was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one, and thereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers, whose business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive, as the ferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey. The motto which I adopted when I started from slavery was this—“Trust no man!” I saw in every white man an enemy, and in almost every colored man cause for distrust. It was a most painful situation; and, to understand it, one must needs experience it, or imagine himself in similar circumstances. Let him be a fugitive slave in a strange land—a land given up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders—whose inhabitants are legalized kidnappers—where he is every moment subjected to the terrible liability of being seized upon by his fellowmen, as the hideous crocodile seizes upon his prey!—I say, let him place himself in my situation—without home or friends—without money or credit—wanting shelter, and no one to give it—wanting bread, and no money to buy it,—and at the same time let him feel that he is pursued by merciless men-hunters, and in total darkness as to what to do, where to go, or where to stay,—perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and means of escape,—in the midst of plenty, yet suffering the terrible gnawings of hunger,—in the midst of houses, yet having no home,—among fellow-men, yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts, whose greediness to swallow up the trembling and half-famished fugitive is only equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which they subsist,—I say, let him be placed in this most trying situation,—the situation in which I was placed,—then, and not till then, will he fully appreciate the hardships of, and know how to sympathize with, the toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000387\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000387\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000388\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000388\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Thank Heaven, I remained but a short time in this distressed situation.

The impression which I had received respecting the character and condition of the people of the north, I found to be singularly erroneous. I had very strangely supposed, while in slavery, that few of the comforts, and scarcely any of the luxuries, of life were enjoyed at the north, compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the south. I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern people owned no slaves. I supposed that they were about upon a level with the non-slaveholding population of the south. I knew <i>they</i> were exceedingly poor, and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders. I had somehow imbibed the opinion that, in the absence of slaves, there could be no wealth, and very little refinement. And upon coming to the north, I expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, and uncultivated population, living in the most Spartan-like simplicity, knowing nothing of the ease, luxury, pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders. Such being my conjectures, any one acquainted with the appearance of New Bedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my mistake.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000407\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000407\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000408\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000408\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford, I visited the wharves, to take a view of the shipping. Here I found myself surrounded with the strongest proofs of wealth. Lying at the wharves, and riding in the stream, I saw many ships of the finest model, in the best order, and of the largest size. Upon the right and left, I was walled in by granite warehouses of the widest dimensions, stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life. Added to this, almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore. There were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships. I heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer. I saw no whipping of men; but all seemed to go smoothly on. Every man appeared to understand his work, and went at it with a sober, yet cheerful earnestness, which betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing, as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man. To me this looked exceedingly strange. From the wharves I strolled around and over the town, gazing with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches, beautiful dwellings, and finely-cultivated gardens; evincing an amount of wealth, comfort, taste, and refinement, such as I had never seen in any part of slaveholding Maryland.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000409\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000409\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000410\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000410\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Every thing looked clean, new, and beautiful. I saw few or no dilapidated houses, with poverty-stricken inmates; no half-naked children and barefooted women, such as I had been accustomed to see in Hillsborough, Easton, St. Michael’s, and Baltimore. The people looked more able, stronger, healthier, and happier, than those of Maryland. I was for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth, without being saddened by seeing extreme poverty. But the most astonishing as well as the most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored people, a great many of whom, like myself, had escaped thither as a refuge from the hunters of men. I found many, who had not been seven years out of their chains, living in finer houses, and evidently enjoying more of the comforts of life, than the average of slaveholders in Maryland. I will venture to assert, that my friend Mr. Nathan Johnson (of whom I can say with a grateful heart, “I was hungry, and he gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink; I was a stranger, and he took me in”) lived in a neater house; dined at a better table; took, paid for, and read, more newspapers; better understood the moral, religious, and political character of the nation,—than nine tenths of the slaveholders in Talbot county Maryland. Yet Mr. Johnson was a working man. His hands were hardened by toil, and not his alone, but those also of Mrs. Johnson. I found the colored people much more spirited than I had supposed they would be. I found among them a determination to protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper, at all hazards. Soon after my arrival, I was told of a circumstance which illustrated their spirit. A colored man and a fugitive slave were on unfriendly terms. The former was heard to threaten the latter with informing his master of his whereabouts. Straightway a meeting was called among the colored people, under the stereotyped notice, “Business of importance!” The betrayer was invited to attend. The people came at the appointed hour, and organized the meeting by appointing a very religious old gentleman as president, who, I believe, made a prayer, after which he addressed the meeting as follows: “<i>Friends, we have got him here, and I would recommend that you young men just take him outside the door, and kill him!</i>” With this, a number of them bolted at him; but they were intercepted by some more timid than themselves, and the betrayer escaped their vengeance, and has not been seen in New Bedford since. I believe there have been no more such threats, and should there be hereafter, I doubt not that death would be the consequence.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000411\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000411\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000412\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000412\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>I found employment, the third day after my arrival, in stowing a sloop with a load of oil.

I seldom had much to say at the meetings, because what I wanted to say was said so much better by others. But, while attending an anti-slavery convention at Nantucket, on the 11th of August, 1841, I felt strongly moved to speak, and was at the same time much urged to do so by Mr. William C. Coffin, a gentleman who had heard me speak in the colored people’s meeting at New Bedford. It was a severe cross, and I took it up reluctantly. The truth was, I felt myself a slave, and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me down. I spoke but a few moments, when I felt a degree of freedom, and said what I desired with considerable ease.

To remove the liability of such misapprehension, I deem it proper to append the following brief explanation. What I have said respecting and against religion, I mean strictly to apply to the <i>slaveholding religion</i> of this land, and with no possible reference to Christianity proper; for, between the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest possible difference—so wide, that to receive the one as good, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, and wicked. To be the friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy of the other. I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels. Never was there a clearer case of “stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in.” I am filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious pomp and show, together with the horrible inconsistencies, which every where surround me. We have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members. The man who wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday, and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus. The man who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me as a class-leader on Sunday morning, to show me the way of life, and the path of salvation. He who sells my sister, for purposes of prostitution, stands forth as the pious advocate of purity. He who proclaims it a religious duty to read the Bible denies me the right of learning to read the name of the God who made me. He who is the religious advocate of marriage robs whole millions of its sacred influence, and leaves them to the ravages of wholesale pollution. The warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same that scatters whole families,—sundering husbands and wives, parents and children, sisters and brothers,—leaving the hut vacant, and the hearth desolate. We see the thief preaching against theft, and the adulterer against adultery. We have men sold to build churches, women sold to support the gospel, and babes sold to purchase Bibles for the <i>Poor Heathen! All For The Glory Of God And The Good Of Souls!</i> The slave auctioneer’s bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other, and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his pious master. Revivals of religion and revivals in the slave-trade go hand in hand together. The slave prison and the church stand near each other. The clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in the prison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church, may be heard at the same time. The dealers in the bodies and souls of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other. The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other—devils dressed in angels’ robes, and hell presenting the semblance of paradise.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000424\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000424\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000425\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000425\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"poem\\\">“Just God! and these are they,v Who minister at thine altar, God of right!<br>\\nMen who their hands, with prayer and blessing, lay<br>\\nOn Israel’s ark of light.<br>\\n<br>\\n“What! preach, and kidnap men?<br>\\nGive thanks, and rob thy own afflicted poor?<br>\\nTalk of thy glorious liberty, and then<br>\\nBolt hard the captive’s door?<br>\\n<br>\\n“What! servants of thy own<br>\\nMerciful Son, who came to seek and save<br>\\nThe homeless and the outcast, fettering down<br>\\nThe tasked and plundered slave!<br>\\n<br>\\n“Pilate and Herod friends!<br>\\nChief priests and rulers, as of old, combine!<br>\\nJust God and holy! is that church which lends<br>\\nStrength to the spoiler thine?”</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000426\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000426\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000427\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000427\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The Christianity of America is a Christianity, of whose votaries it may be as truly said, as it was of the ancient scribes and Pharisees, “They bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.

They attend with Pharisaical strictness to the outward forms of religion, and at the same time neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. They are always ready to sacrifice, but seldom to show mercy. They are they who are represented as professing to love God whom they have not seen, whilst they hate their brother whom they have seen. They love the heathen on the other side of the globe. They can pray for him, pay money to have the Bible put into his hand, and missionaries to instruct him; while they despise and totally neglect the heathen at their own doors.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000430\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000430\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000431\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/1ec6a0584d1b40ed/text/000000431\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-fdf265 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-56aed2 twpub-1ec6a0584d1b40ed-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Such is, very briefly, my view of the religion of this land; and to avoid any misunderstanding, growing out of the use of general terms, I mean by the religion of this land, that which is revealed in the words, deeds, and actions, of those bodies, north and south, calling themselves Christian churches, and yet in union with slaveholders.
