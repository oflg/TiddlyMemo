It is thus, fitly enough, the last important English book written before the introduction of printing into this country, and since no manuscript of it has come down to us it is also the first English classic for our knowledge of which we are entirely dependent on a printed text. Caxton’s story of how the book was brought to him and he was induced to print it may be read farther on in his own preface. From this we learn also that he was not only the printer of the book, but to some extent its editor also, dividing Malory’s work into twenty-one books, splitting up the books into chapters, by no means skilfully, and supplying the “Rubrish” or chapter-headings. It may be added that Caxton’s preface contains, moreover, a brief criticism which, on the points on which it touches, is still the soundest and most sympathetic that has been written.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000013\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000013\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000014\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000014\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Caxton finished his edition the last day of July 1485, some fifteen or sixteen years after Malory wrote his epilogue. It is clear that the author was then dead, or the printer would not have acted as a clumsy editor to the book, and recent discoveries (if bibliography may, for the moment, enlarge its bounds to mention such matters) have revealed with tolerable certainty when Malory died and who he was. In letters to The Athenaeum in July 1896 Mr. T. Williams pointed out that the name of a Sir Thomas Malorie occurred among those of a number of other Lancastrians excluded from a general pardon granted by Edward IV. in 1468, and that a William Mallerye was mentioned in the same year as taking part in a Lancastrian rising. In September 1897, again, in another letter to the same paper, Mr. A. T. Martin reported the finding of the will of a Thomas Malory of Papworth, a hundred partly in Cambridgeshire, partly in Hunts. This will was made on September 16, 1469, and as it was proved the 27th of the next month the testator must have been in immediate expectation of death. It contains the most careful provision for the education and starting in life of a family of three daughters and seven sons, of whom the youngest seems to have been still an infant. We cannot say with certainty that this Thomas Malory, whose last thoughts were so busy for his children, was our author, or that the Lancastrian knight discovered by Mr. Williams was identical with either or both, but such evidence as the Morte D’Arthur offers favours such a belief. There is not only the epilogue with its petition, “pray for me while I am alive that God send me good deliverance and when I am dead pray you all for my soul,” but this very request is foreshadowed at the end of chap. 37 of Book ix. in the touching passage, surely inspired by personal experience, as to the sickness “that is the greatest pain a prisoner may have”; and the reflections on English fickleness in the first chapter of Book xxi., though the Wars of the Roses might have inspired them in any one, come most naturally from an author who was a Lancastrian knight.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000015\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000015\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000016\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000016\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>If the Morte D’Arthur was really written in prison and by a prisoner distressed by ill-health as well as by lack of liberty, surely no task was ever better devised to while away weary hours. Leaving abundant scope for originality in selection, modification, and arrangement, as a compilation and translation it had in it that mechanical element which adds the touch of restfulness to literary work. No original, it is said, has yet been found for Book vii., and it is possible that none will ever be forthcoming for chap. 20 of Book xviii., which describes the arrival of the body of the Fair Maiden of Astolat at Arthur’s court, or vii for chap. 25 of the same book, with its discourse on true love; but the great bulk of the work has been traced chapter by chapter to the “Merlin” of Robert de Borron and his successors (Bks. i.-iv.), the English metrical romance La Morte Arthur of the Thornton manuscript (Bk. v.), the French romances of Tristan (Bks. viii.-x.) and of Launcelot (Bks. vi., xi.-xix.), and lastly to the English prose Morte Arthur of Harley MS. 2252 (Bks. xviii., xx., xxi.). As to Malory’s choice of his authorities critics have not failed to point out that now and again he gives a worse version where a better has come down to us, and if he had been able to order a complete set of Arthurian manuscripts from his bookseller, no doubt he would have done even better than he did! But of the skill, approaching to original genius, with which he used the books from which he worked there is little dispute.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000017\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000017\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000018\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000018\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Malory died leaving his work obviously unrevised, and in this condition it was brought to Caxton, who prepared it for the press with his usual enthusiasm in the cause of good literature, and also, it must be added, with his usual carelessness. New chapters are sometimes made to begin in the middle of a sentence, and in addition to simple misprints there are numerous passages in which it is impossible to believe that we have the text as Malory intended it to stand. After Caxton’s edition Malory’s manuscript must have disappeared, and subsequent editions are differentiated only by the degree of closeness with which they follow the first. Editions appeared printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1498 and 1529, by William Copland in 1559, by Thomas East about 1585, and by Thomas Stansby in 1634, each printer apparently taking the text of his immediate predecessor and reproducing it with modifications. Stansby’s edition served for reprints in 1816 and 1856 (the latter edited by Thomas Wright); but in 1817 an edition supervised by Robert Southey went back to Caxton’s text, though to a copy (only two are extant, and only one perfect!) in which eleven leaves were supplied from Wynkyn de Worde’s reprint. In 1868 Sir Edward Strachey produced for the present publishers a reprint of Southey’s text in modern spelling, with the substitution of current words for those now obsolete, and the softening of a handful of passages likely, he thought, to prevent the book being placed in the hands of boys. In 1889 a boon was conferred on scholars by the publication of Dr. H. Oskar Sommer’s page-for-page reprint of Caxton’s text, with an elaborate discussion of Malory’s sources. Dr. Sommer’s edition was used by Sir E. Strachey to revise his Globe text, and in 1897 Mr. Israel Gollancz produced for the “Temple Classics” a very pretty edition in which Sir Edward Strachey’s principles of modernisation in spelling and punctuation were adopted, but with the restoration of obsolete words and omitted phrases. As to the present edition, Sir Edward Strachey altered with so sparing a hand that on many pages differences between his version and that here printed will be looked for in vain; but the most anxious care has been taken to produce a text modernised as to its spelling, but in other respects in accurate accordance with Caxton’s text, as represented by Dr Sommer’s reprint. Obvious misprints have been silently corrected, but in a few cases notes show where emendations have been introduced from Wynkyn de Worde—not that Wynkyn had any more right to emend Caxton than we, but because even a printer’s conjecture gains a little sanctity after four centuries. The restoration of obsolete words has necessitated a much fuller glossary, and the index of names has therefore been separated from it and enlarged. In its present form the index is the work of Mr. Henry Littlehales.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000019\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000019\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000020\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000020\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p class=\\\"right\\\">A.

And as for the three Jews, which also were to-fore the incarnation of our Lord, of whom the first was duke Joshua which brought the children of Israel into the land of behest, the second David king of Jerusalem, and the third Judas Machabeus, of these three the Bible rehearseth all their noble histories and acts. And since the said Incarnation have been three noble Christian men, stalled and admitted through the universal world into the number of the nine best and worthy. Of whom was first the noble Arthur, whose noble acts I purpose to write in this present book here following. The second was Charlemain, or Charles the Great, of whom the history is had in many places, both in French and in English. And the third and last was Godfrey of Boloine, of whose acts and life I made a book unto the excellent prince and king of noble memory, King Edward the Fourth.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000026\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000026\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000027\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000027\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The said noble gentlemen instantly required me to imprint the history of the said noble king and conqueror King Arthur, and of his knights, with the history of the Saint Greal, and of the death and ending of the said Arthur; affirming that I ought rather to imprint his acts and noble feats, than of Godfrey of Boloine, or any of the other eight, considering that he was a man born within this realm, and king and emperor of the same: and that there be in French divers and many noble volumes of his acts, and also of his knights. To whom I answered that divers men hold opinion that there was no such Arthur, and that all such books as been made of him be feigned and fables, because that some chronicles make of him no mention, nor remember him nothing, nor of his knights. Whereto they answered, and one in special said, that in him that should say or think that there was never such a king called Arthur might well be aretted great folly and blindness. For he said that there were many evidences of the contrary. First ye may see his sepulchre in the monastery of Glastonbury. And also in Policronicon, in the fifth book the sixth chapter, and in the seventh book the twenty-third chapter, where his body was buried, and after found, and translated into the said monastery. Ye shall see also in the history of Bochas, in his book De Casu Principum, part of his noble acts, and also of his fall. Also Galfridus in his British book recounteth his life: and in divers places of England many remembrances be yet of him, and shall remain perpetually, and also of his knights. First in the abbey of Westminster, at St. Edward’s shrine, remaineth the print of his seal in red wax closed in beryl, in which is written, Patricius Arthurus Britannie, Gallie, Germanie, Dacie, Imperator. Item in the castle of Dover ye may see Gawaine’s skull, and Cradok’s mantle: at Winchester the Round Table: in other places Launcelot’s sword and many other things. Then all these things considered, there can no man reasonably gainsay but there was a king of this land named Arthur. For in all places, Christian and heathen, he is reputed and taken for one of the nine worthy, and the first of the three Christian men. And also, he is more spoken of beyond the sea, more books made of his noble acts, than there be in England, as well in Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Greekish, as in French. And yet of record remain in witness of him in Wales, in the town of Camelot, the great stones and the marvellous works of iron lying under the ground, and royal vaults, which divers now living have seen. Wherefore it is a marvel why he is no more renowned in his own country, save only it accordeth to the Word of God, which saith that no man is accepted for a prophet in his own country.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000028\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000028\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000029\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000029\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then all these things aforesaid alleged, I could not well deny but that there was such a noble king named Arthur, and reputed one of the nine worthy, and first and chief of the Christian men.

But in Welsh be many and also in French, and some in English but nowhere nigh all. Wherefore, such as have late been drawn out briefly into English I have after the simple conning that God hath sent to me, under the favour and correction of all noble lords and gentlemen, enprised to imprint a book of the noble histories of the said King Arthur, and of certain of his knights, after a copy unto me delivered, which copy Sir Thomas Malorye did take out of certain books of French, and reduced it into English. And I, according to my copy, have done set it in imprint, to the intent that noble men may see and learn the noble acts of chivalry, the gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights used in those days, by which they came to honour, and how they that were vicious were punished and oft put to shame and rebuke; humbly beseeching all noble lords and ladies, with all other estates of what estate or degree they been of, that shall see and read in this said book and work, that they take the good and honest acts in their remembrance, and to follow the same. Wherein they shall find many joyous and pleasant histories, and noble and renowned acts of humanity, gentleness, and chivalry. For herein may be seen noble chivalry, courtesy, humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship, cowardice, murder, hate, virtue, and sin. Do after the good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renown. And for to pass the time this book shall be pleasant to read in, but for to give faith and belief that all is true that is contained herein, ye be at your liberty: but all is written for our doctrine, and for to beware that we fall not to vice nor sin, but to exercise and follow virtue, by which we may come and attain to good fame and renown in this life, and after this short and transitory life to come unto everlasting bliss in heaven; the which He grant us that reigneth in heaven, the blessed Trinity.

And in the meanwhile his enemies usurped upon him, and did a great battle upon his men, and slew many of his people. Sir, said Merlin, ye may not lie so as ye do, for ye must to the field though ye ride on an horse-litter: for ye shall never have the better of your enemies but if your person be there, and then shall ye have the victory. So it was done as Merlin had devised, and they carried the king forth in an horse-litter with a great host towards his enemies. And at St. Albans there met with the king a great host of the North. And that day Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias did great deeds of arms, and King Uther’s men overcame the Northern battle and slew many people, and put the remnant to flight. And then the king returned unto London, and made great joy of his victory. And then he fell passing sore sick, so that three days and three nights he was speechless: wherefore all the barons made great sorrow, and asked Merlin what counsel were best. There is none other remedy, said Merlin, but God will have his will. But look ye all barons be before King Uther to-morn, and God and I shall make him to speak. So on the morn all the barons with Merlin came to-fore the king; then Merlin said aloud unto King Uther, Sir, shall your son Arthur be king after your days, of this realm with all the appurtenance? Then Uther Pendragon turned him, and said in hearing of them all, I give him God’s blessing and mine, and bid him pray for my soul, and righteously and worshipfully that he claim the crown, upon forfeiture of my blessing; and therewith he yielded up the ghost, and then was he interred as longed to a king.

Then Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled him for to send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of arms, that they should to London come by Christmas, upon pain of cursing; and for this cause, that Jesus, that was born on that night, that he would of his great mercy show some miracle, as he was come to be king of mankind, for to show some miracle who should be rightwise king of this realm. So the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent for all the lords and gentlemen of arms that they should come by Christmas even unto London. And many of them made them clean of their life, that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto God. So in the greatest church of London, whether it were Paul’s or not the French book maketh no mention, all the estates were long or day in the church for to pray. And when matins and the first mass was done, there was seen in the churchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four square, like unto a marble stone; and in midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point, and letters there were written in gold about the sword that said thus:—Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise king born of all England.

So as they rode to the jousts-ward, Sir Kay lost his sword, for he had left it at his father’s lodging, and so he prayed young Arthur for to ride for his sword. I will well, said Arthur, and rode fast after the sword, and when he came home, the lady and all were out to see the jousting. Then was Arthur wroth, and said to himself, I will ride to the churchyard, and take the sword with me that sticketh in the stone, for my brother Sir Kay shall not be without a sword this day. So when he came to the churchyard, Sir Arthur alighted and tied his horse to the stile, and so he went to the tent, and found no knights there, for they were at the jousting. And so he handled the sword by the handles, and lightly and fiercely pulled it out of the stone, and took his horse and rode his way until he came to his brother Sir Kay, and delivered him the sword. And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he wist well it was the sword of the stone, and so he rode to his father Sir Ector, and said: Sir, lo here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I must be king of this land. When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he returned again and came to the church, and there they alighted all three, and went into the church. And anon he made Sir Kay swear upon a book how he came to that sword. Sir, said Sir Kay, by my brother Arthur, for he brought it to me. How gat ye this sword? said Sir Ector to Arthur. Sir, I will tell you. When I came home for my brother’s sword, I found nobody at home to deliver me his sword; and so I thought my brother Sir Kay should not be swordless, and so I came hither eagerly and pulled it out of the stone without any pain. Found ye any knights about this sword? said Sir Ector. Nay, said Arthur. Now, said Sir Ector to Arthur, I understand ye must be king of this land. Wherefore I, said Arthur, and for what cause? Sir, said Ector, for God will have it so; for there should never man have drawn out this sword, but he that shall be rightwise king of this land.

And as Arthur sped before, so did he at Easter; yet there were some of the great lords had indignation that Arthur should be king, and put it off in a delay till the feast of Pentecost.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000085\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000085\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000086\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000086\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then the Archbishop of Canterbury by Merlin’s providence let purvey then of the best knights that they might get, and such knights as Uther Pendragon loved best and most trusted in his days.

Unto the feast came King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney, with five hundred knights with him. Also there came to the feast King Uriens of Gore with four hundred knights with him. Also there came to that feast King Nentres of Garlot, with seven hundred knights with him. Also there came to the feast the king of Scotland with six hundred knights with him, and he was but a young man. Also there came to the feast a king that was called the King with the Hundred Knights, but he and his men were passing well beseen at all points. Also there came the king of Carados with five hundred knights. And King Arthur was glad of their coming, for he weened that all the kings and knights had come for great love, and to have done him worship at his feast; wherefore the king made great joy, and sent the kings and knights great presents. But the kings would none receive, but rebuked the messengers shamefully, and said they had no joy to receive no gifts of a beardless boy that was come of low blood, and sent him word they would none of his gifts, but that they were come to give him gifts with hard swords betwixt the neck and the shoulders: and therefore they came thither, so they told to the messengers plainly, for it was great shame to all them to see such a boy to have a rule of so noble a realm as this land was. With this answer the messengers departed and told to King Arthur this answer. Wherefore, by the advice of his barons, he took him to a strong tower with five hundred good men with him. And all the kings aforesaid in a manner laid a siege to-fore him, but King Arthur was well victualed. And within fifteen days there came Merlin among them into the city of Carlion. Then all the kings were passing glad of Merlin, and asked him, For what cause is that boy Arthur made your king? Sirs, said Merlin, I shall tell you the cause, for he is King Uther Pendragon’s son, born in wedlock, gotten on Igraine, the duke’s wife of Tintagil. Then is he a bastard, they said all. Nay, said Merlin, after the death of the duke, more than three hours, was Arthur begotten, and thirteen days after King Uther wedded Igraine; and therefore I prove him he is no bastard. And who saith nay, he shall be king and overcome all his enemies; and, or he die, he shall be long king of all England, and have under his obeissance Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and more realms than I will now rehearse. Some of the kings had marvel of Merlin’s words, and deemed well that it should be as he said; and some of them laughed him to scorn, as King Lot; and more other called him a witch. But then were they accorded with Merlin, that King Arthur should come out and speak with the kings, and to come safe and to go safe, such surance there was made. So Merlin went unto King Arthur, and told him how he had done, and bade him fear not, but come out boldly and speak with them, and spare them not, but answer them as their king and chieftain; for ye shall overcome them all, whether they will or nill.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000099\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000099\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000100\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000100\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000101\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000101\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>\\nOf the first war that King Arthur had, and how he won the field.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000102\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000102\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000103\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000103\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then King Arthur came out of his tower, and had under his gown a jesseraunt of double mail, and there went with him the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir Baudwin of Britain, and Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias: these were the men of most worship that were with him.

Wherefore the king asked counsel at them all. They could no counsel give, but said they were big enough. Ye say well, said Arthur; I thank you for your good courage, but will ye all that loveth me speak with Merlin? ye know well that he hath done much for me, and he knoweth many things, and when he is afore you, I would that ye prayed him heartily of his best advice. All the barons said they would pray him and desire him. So Merlin was sent for, and fair desired of all the barons to give them best counsel. I shall say you, said Merlin, I warn you all, your enemies are passing strong for you, and they are good men of arms as be alive, and by this time they have gotten to them four kings more, and a mighty duke; and unless that our king have more chivalry with him than he may make within the bounds of his own realm, an he fight with them in battle, he shall be overcome and slain. What were best to do in this cause? said all the barons. I shall tell you, said Merlin, mine advice; there are two brethren beyond the sea, and they be kings both, and marvellous good men of their hands; and that one hight King Ban of Benwick, and that other hight King Bors of Gaul, that is France. And on these two kings warreth a mighty man of men, the King Claudas, and striveth with them for a castle, and great war is betwixt them. But this Claudas is so mighty of goods whereof he getteth good knights, that he putteth these two kings most part to the worse; wherefore this is my counsel, that our king and sovereign lord send unto the kings Ban and Bors by two trusty knights with letters well devised, that an they will come and see King Arthur and his court, and so help him in his wars, that he will be sworn unto them to help them in their wars against King Claudas. Now, what say ye unto this counsel? said Merlin. This is well counselled, said the king and all the barons.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000111\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000111\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000112\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000112\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Right so in all haste there were ordained to go two knights on the message unto the two kings.

But anon, as the two kings wist they were messengers of Arthur’s, there was made no tarrying, but forthwith they spake with the knights, and welcomed them in the faithfullest wise, and said they were most welcome unto them before all the kings living; and therewith they kissed the letters and delivered them. And when Ban and Bors understood the letters, then they were more welcome than they were before. And after the haste of the letters they gave them this answer, that they would fulfil the desire of King Arthur’s writing, and Ulfius and Brastias, tarry there as long as they would, they should have such cheer as might be made them in those marches. Then Ulfius and Brastias told the kings of the adventure at their passages of the eight knights. Ha! ah! said Ban and Bors, they were my good friends. I would I had wist of them; they should not have escaped so. So Ulfius and Brastias had good cheer and great gifts, as much as they might bear away; and had their answer by mouth and by writing, that those two kings would come unto Arthur in all the haste that they might. So the two knights rode on afore, and passed the sea, and came to their lord, and told him how they had sped, whereof King Arthur was passing glad. At what time suppose ye the two kings will be here? Sir, said they, afore All Hallowmass. Then the king let purvey for a great feast, and let cry a great jousts. And by All Hallowmass the two kings were come over the sea with three hundred knights well arrayed both for the peace and for the war. And King Arthur met with them ten mile out of London, and there was great joy as could be thought or made. And on All Hallowmass at the great feast, sat in the hall the three kings, and Sir Kay seneschal served in the hall, and Sir Lucas the butler, that was Duke Corneus’ son, and Sir Griflet, that was the son of Cardol, these three knights had the rule of all the service that served the kings. And anon, as they had washen and risen, all knights that would joust made them ready; by then they were ready on horseback there were seven hundred knights. And Arthur, Ban, and Bors, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir Ector, Kay’s father, they were in a place covered with cloth of gold like an hall, with ladies and gentlewomen, for to behold who did best, and thereon to give judgment.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000115\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000115\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000116\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000116\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000117\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000117\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>\\nOf a great tourney made by King Arthur and the two kings Ban and Bors, and how they went over the sea.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000118\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000118\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000119\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000119\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And King Arthur and the two kings let depart the seven hundred knights in two parties.

And after they had been in council, they went unto bed. And on the morn they heard mass, and to dinner, and so to their council, and made many arguments what were best to do. At the last they were concluded, that Merlin should go with a token of King Ban, and that was a ring, unto his men and King Bors’; and Gracian and Placidas should go again and keep their castles and their countries, as for [dread of King Claudas] King Ban of Benwick, and King Bors of Gaul had ordained them, and so passed the sea and came to Benwick. And when the people saw King Ban’s ring, and Gracian and Placidas, they were glad, and asked how the kings fared, and made great joy of their welfare and cording, and according unto the sovereign lords desire, the men of war made them ready in all haste possible, so that they were fifteen thousand on horse and foot, and they had great plenty of victual with them, by Merlin’s provision. But Gracian and Placidas were left to furnish and garnish the castles, for dread of King Claudas. Right so Merlin passed the sea, well victualled both by water and by land.

All the three kings and the whole barons said that Merlin said passingly well, and it was done anon as Merlin had devised. So on the morn, when either host saw other, the host of the north was well comforted.

Gramercy, said Ulfius. Then Sir Arthur did so marvellously in arms, that all men had wonder.

And when King Arthur saw the king ride on Sir Ector’s horse, he was wroth and with his sword he smote the king on the helm, that a quarter of the helm and shield fell down, and so the sword carved down unto the horse’s neck, and so the king and the horse fell down to the ground. Then Sir Kay came unto Sir Morganore, seneschal with the King of the Hundred Knights, and smote him down, horse and man, and led the horse unto his father, Sir Ector; then Sir Ector ran unto a knight, hight Lardans, and smote horse and man down, and led the horse unto Sir Brastias, that great need had of an horse, and was greatly defoiled. When Brastias beheld Lucas the butler, that lay like a dead man under the horses’ feet, and ever Sir Griflet did marvellously for to rescue him, and there were always fourteen knights on Sir Lucas; then Brastias smote one of them on the helm, that it went to the teeth, and he rode to another and smote him, that the arm flew into the field. Then he went to the third and smote him on the shoulder, that shoulder and arm flew in the field. And when Griflet saw rescues, he smote a knight on the temples, that head and helm went to the earth, and Griflet took the horse of that knight, and led him unto Sir Lucas, and bade him mount upon the horse and revenge his hurts.

Also Lucas found there on foot, Bloias de La Flandres, and Sir Gwinas, two hardy knights, and in that woodness that Lucas was in, he slew two bachelors and horsed them again. Then waxed the battle passing hard on both parties, but Arthur was glad that his knights were horsed again, and then they fought together, that the noise and sound rang by the water and the wood. Wherefore King Ban and King Bors made them ready, and dressed their shields and harness, and they were so courageous that many knights shook and bevered for eagerness. All this while Lucas, and Gwinas, and Briant, and Bellias of Flanders, held strong medley against six kings, that was King Lot, King Nentres, King Brandegoris, King Idres, King Uriens, and King Agwisance. So with the help of Sir Kay and of Sir Griflet they held these six kings hard, that unnethe they had any power to defend them. But when Sir Arthur saw the battle would not be ended by no manner, he fared wood as a lion, and steered his horse here and there, on the right hand, and on the left hand, that he stinted not till he had slain twenty knights. Also he wounded King Lot sore on the shoulder, and made him to leave that ground, for Sir Kay and Griflet did with King Arthur there great deeds of arms. Then Ulfius, and Brastias, and Sir Ector encountered against the Duke Eustace, and King Cradelment, and King Clariance of Northumberland, and King Carados, and against the King with the Hundred Knights. So these knights encountered with these kings, that they made them to avoid the ground. Then King Lot made great dole for his damages and his fellows, and said unto the ten kings, But if ye will do as I devise we shall be slain and destroyed; let me have the King with the Hundred Knights, and King Agwisance, and King Idres, and the Duke of Cambenet, and we five kings will have fifteen thousand men of arms with us, and we will go apart while ye six kings hold medley with twelve thousand; an we see that ye have foughten with them long, then will we come on fiercely, and else shall we never match them, said King Lot, but by this mean.

When King Bors saw those knights put aback, it grieved him sore; then he came on so fast that his fellowship seemed as black as Inde.

What is he? said the King with the Hundred Knights. It is, said King Lot, King Bors of Gaul; I marvel how they came into this country without witting of us all. It was by Merlin’s advice, said the knight. As for him, said King Carados, I will encounter with King Bors, an ye will rescue me when myster is. Go on, said they all, we will do all that we may.

That wot we well, said King Ban and King Bors, for they are your mortal enemies, and that hath been proved aforehand; and this day they have done their part, and that is great pity of their wilfulness.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000165\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000165\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000166\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000166\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then all the eleven kings drew them together, and then said King Lot, Lords, ye must other ways than ye do, or else the great loss is behind; ye may see what people we have lost, and what good men we lose, because we wait always on these foot-men, and ever in saving of one of the foot-men we lose ten horsemen for him; therefore this is mine advice, let us put our foot-men from us, for it is near night, for the noble Arthur will not tarry on the footmen, for they may save themselves, the wood is near hand.

With that, there dressed them a forty noble knights, and said unto the three kings, they would break their battle; these were their names: Lionses, Phariance, Ulfius, Brastias, Ector, Kay, Lucas the butler, Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Mariet de la Roche, Guinas de Bloi, Briant de la Forest Savage, Bellaus, Morians of the Castle [of] Maidens, Flannedrius of the Castle of Ladies, Annecians that was King Bors’ godson, a noble knight, Ladinas de la Rouse, Emerause, Caulas, Graciens le Castlein, one Blois de la Case, and Sir Colgrevaunce de Gorre; all these knights rode on afore with spears on their thighs, and spurred their horses mightily as the horses might run. And the eleven kings with part of their knights rushed with their horses as fast as they might with their spears, and there they did on both parties marvellous deeds of arms. So came into the thick of the press, Arthur, Ban, and Bors, and slew down right on both hands, that their horses went in blood up to the fetlocks. But ever the eleven kings and their host was ever in the visage of Arthur. Wherefore Ban and Bors had great marvel, considering the great slaughter that there was, but at the last they were driven aback over a little river. With that came Merlin on a great black horse, and said unto Arthur, Thou hast never done! Hast thou not done enough? of three score thousand this day hast thou left alive but fifteen thousand, and it is time to say Ho! For God is wroth with thee, that thou wilt never have done; for yonder eleven kings at this time will not be overthrown, but an thou tarry on them any longer, thy fortune will turn and they shall increase. And therefore withdraw you unto your lodging, and rest you as soon as ye may, and reward your good knights with gold and with silver, for they have well deserved it; there may no riches be too dear for them, for of so few men as ye have, there were never men did more of prowess than they have done today, for ye have matched this day with the best fighters of the world. That is truth, said King Ban and Bors. Also said Merlin, withdraw you where ye list, for this three year I dare undertake they shall not dere you; and by then ye shall hear new tidings. And then Merlin said unto Arthur, These eleven kings have more on hand than they are ware of, for the Saracens are landed in their countries, more than forty thousand, that burn and slay, and have laid siege at the castle Wandesborow, and make great destruction; therefore dread you not this three year. Also, sir, all the goods that be gotten at this battle, let it be searched, and when ye have it in your hands, let it be given freely unto these two kings, Ban and Bors, that they may reward their knights withal; and that shall cause strangers to be of better will to do you service at need. Also you be able to reward your own knights of your own goods whensomever it liketh you. It is well said, quoth Arthur, and as thou hast devised, so shall it be done. When it was delivered to Ban and Bors, they gave the goods as freely to their knights as freely as it was given to them. Then Merlin took his leave of Arthur and of the two kings, for to go and see his master Bleise, that dwelt in Northumberland; and so he departed and came to his master, that was passing glad of his coming; and there he told how Arthur and the two kings had sped at the great battle, and how it was ended, and told the names of every king and knight of worship that was there. And so Bleise wrote the battle word by word, as Merlin told him, how it began, and by whom, and in likewise how it was ended, and who had the worse. All the battles that were done in Arthur’s days Merlin did his master Bleise do write; also he did do write all the battles that every worthy knight did of Arthur’s court.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000172\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000172\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000173\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000173\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After this Merlin departed from his master and came to King Arthur, that was in the castle of Bedegraine, that was one of the castles that stand in the forest of Sherwood. And Merlin was so disguised that King Arthur knew him not, for he was all befurred in black sheep-skins, and a great pair of boots, and a bow and arrows, in a russet gown, and brought wild geese in his hand, and it was on the morn after Candlemas day; but King Arthur knew him not. Sir, said Merlin unto the king, will ye give me a gift? Wherefore, said King Arthur, should I give thee a gift, churl? Sir, said Merlin, ye were better to give me a gift that is not in your hand than to lose great riches, for here in the same place where the great battle was, is great treasure hid in the earth. Who told thee so, churl? said Arthur. Merlin told me so, said he. Then Ulfius and Brastias knew him well enough, and smiled. Sir, said these two knights, it is Merlin that so speaketh unto you. Then King Arthur was greatly abashed, and had marvel of Merlin, and so had King Ban and King Bors, and so they had great disport at him. So in the meanwhile there came a damosel that was an earl’s daughter: his name was Sanam, and her name was Lionors, a passing fair damosel; and so she came thither for to do homage, as other lords did after the great battle. And King Arthur set his love greatly upon her, and so did she upon him, and the king had ado with her, and gat on her a child: his name was Borre, that was after a good knight, and of the Table Round. Then there came word that the King Rience of North Wales made great war on King Leodegrance of Cameliard, for the which thing Arthur was wroth, for he loved him well, and hated King Rience, for he was alway against him. So by ordinance of the three kings that were sent home unto Benwick, all they would depart for dread of King Claudas; and Phariance, and Antemes, and Gratian, and Lionses [of] Payarne, with the leaders of those that should keep the kings’ lands.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000174\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000174\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000175\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000175\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000176\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000176\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>\\nHow King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors rescued King Leodegrance, and other incidents.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000177\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000177\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000178\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000178\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then King Arthur, and King Ban, and King Bors departed with their fellowship, a twenty thousand, and came within six days into the country of Cameliard, and there rescued King Leodegrance, and slew there much people of King Rience, unto the number of ten thousand men, and put him to flight.

Nay, said the kings, ye shall not at this time, for ye have much to do yet in these lands, therefore we will depart, and with the great goods that we have gotten in these lands by your gifts, we shall wage good knights and withstand the King Claudas’ malice, for by the grace of God, an we have need we will send to you for your succour; and if ye have need, send for us, and we will not tarry, by the faith of our bodies.

As for King Leodegrance, he loveth Arthur better than us, and as for King Rience, he hath enough to do with Leodegrance, for he hath laid siege unto him. So they consented together to keep all the marches of Cornwall, of Wales, and of the North. So first, they put King Idres in the City of Nauntes in Britain, with four thousand men of arms, to watch both the water and the land. Also they put in the city of Windesan, King Nentres of Garlot, with four thousand knights to watch both on water and on land. Also they had of other men of war more than eight thousand, for to fortify all the fortresses in the marches of Cornwall.

And thither came to him, King Lot’s wife, of Orkney, in manner of a message, but she was sent thither to espy the court of King Arthur; and she came richly beseen, with her four sons, Gawaine, Gaheris, Agravine, and Gareth, with many other knights and ladies. For she was a passing fair lady, therefore the king cast great love unto her, and desired to lie by her; so they were agreed, and he begat upon her Mordred, and she was his sister, on his mother’s side, Igraine. So there she rested her a month, and at the last departed. Then the king dreamed a marvellous dream whereof he was sore adread. But all this time King Arthur knew not that King Lot’s wife was his sister. Thus was the dream of Arthur: Him thought there was come into this land griffins and serpents, and him thought they burnt and slew all the people in the land, and then him thought he fought with them, and they did him passing great harm, and wounded him full sore, but at the last he slew them. When the king awaked, he was passing heavy of his dream, and so to put it out of thoughts, he made him ready with many knights to ride a-hunting. As soon as he was in the forest the king saw a great hart afore him. This hart will I chase, said King Arthur, and so he spurred the horse, and rode after long, and so by fine force oft he was like to have smitten the hart; whereas the king had chased the hart so long, that his horse lost his breath, and fell down dead. Then a yeoman fetched the king another horse.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000186\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000186\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000187\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000187\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So the king saw the hart enbushed, and his horse dead, he set him down by a fountain, and there he fell in great thoughts.

And so he was in a great thought, and therewith he fell asleep. Right so there came a knight afoot unto Arthur and said, Knight full of thought and sleepy, tell me if thou sawest a strange beast pass this way. Such one saw I, said King Arthur, that is past two mile; what would ye with the beast? said Arthur. Sir, I have followed that beast long time, and killed mine horse, so would God I had another to follow my quest.

Well, said the king, thou mayst take my horse by force, but an I might prove thee whether thou were better on horseback or I.—Well, said the knight, seek me here when thou wilt, and here nigh this well thou shalt find me, and so passed on his way.

Right so came by him Merlin like a child of fourteen year of age, and saluted the king, and asked him why he was so pensive. I may well be pensive, said the king, for I have seen the marvellest sight that ever I saw. That know I well, said Merlin, as well as thyself, and of all thy thoughts, but thou art but a fool to take thought, for it will not amend thee. Also I know what thou art, and who was thy father, and of whom thou wert begotten; King Uther Pendragon was thy father, and begat thee on Igraine. That is false, said King Arthur, how shouldest thou know it, for thou art not so old of years to know my father? Yes, said Merlin, I know it better than ye or any man living. I will not believe thee, said Arthur, and was wroth with the child.

And anon the king asked Ector and Ulfius how he was begotten, and they told him Uther Pendragon was his father and Queen Igraine his mother. Then he said to Merlin, I will that my mother be sent for that I may speak with her; and if she say so herself then will I believe it.

Sir, said Griflet, I beseech you make me knight. Sir, said Merlin, it were great pity to lose Griflet, for he will be a passing good man when he is of age, abiding with you the term of his life. And if he adventure his body with yonder knight at the fountain, it is in great peril if ever he come again, for he is one of the best knights of the world, and the strongest man of arms. Well, said Arthur. So at the desire of Griflet the king made him knight. Now, said Arthur unto Sir Griflet, sith I have made you knight thou must give me a gift. What ye will, said Griflet. Thou shalt promise me by the faith of thy body, when thou hast jousted with the knight at the fountain, whether it fall ye be on foot or on horseback, that right so ye shall come again unto me without making any more debate. I will promise you, said Griflet, as you desire. Then took Griflet his horse in great haste, and dressed his shield and took a spear in his hand, and so he rode a great wallop till he came to the fountain, and thereby he saw a rich pavilion, and thereby under a cloth stood a fair horse well saddled and bridled, and on a tree a shield of divers colours and a great spear. Then Griflet smote on the shield with the butt of his spear, that the shield fell down to the ground. With that the knight came out of the pavilion, and said, Fair knight, why smote ye down my shield? For I will joust with you, said Griflet. It is better ye do not, said the knight, for ye are but young, and late made knight, and your might is nothing to mine. As for that, said Griflet, I will joust with you. That is me loath, said the knight, but sith I must needs, I will dress me thereto. Of whence be ye? said the knight. Sir, I am of Arthur’s court. So the two knights ran together that Griflet’s spear all to-shivered; and there withal he smote Griflet through the shield and the left side, and brake the spear that the truncheon stuck in his body, that horse and knight fell down.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000209\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000209\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000210\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000210\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000211\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000211\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br>\\nHow twelve knights came from Rome and asked truage for this land of Arthur, and how Arthur fought with a knight.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000212\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000212\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000213\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000213\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>When the knight saw him lie so on the ground, he alighted, and was passing heavy, for he weened he had slain him, and then he unlaced his helm and gat him wind, and so with the truncheon he set him on his horse, and so betook him to God, and said he had a mighty heart, and if he might live he would prove a passing good knight. And so Sir Griflet rode to the court, where great dole was made for him. But through good leeches he was healed and saved. Right so came into the court twelve knights, and were aged men, and they came from the Emperor of Rome, and they asked of Arthur truage for this realm, other else the emperor would destroy him and his land. Well, said King Arthur, ye are messengers, therefore ye may say what ye will, other else ye should die therefore. But this is mine answer: I owe the emperor no truage, nor none will I hold him, but on a fair field I shall give him my truage that shall be with a sharp spear, or else with a sharp sword, and that shall not be long, by my father’s soul, Uther Pendragon. And therewith the messengers departed passingly wroth, and King Arthur as wroth, for in evil time came they then; for the king was passingly wroth for the hurt of Sir Griflet. And so he commanded a privy man of his chamber that or it be day his best horse and armour, with all that longeth unto his person, be without the city or to-morrow day. Right so or to-morrow day he met with his man and his horse, and so mounted up and dressed his shield and took his spear, and bade his chamberlain tarry there till he came again. And so Arthur rode a soft pace till it was day, and then was he ware of three churls chasing Merlin, and would have slain him. Then the king rode unto them, and bade them: Flee, churls! then were they afeard when they saw a knight, and fled. O Merlin, said Arthur, here hadst thou been slain for all thy crafts had I not been. Nay, said Merlin, not so, for I could save myself an I would; and thou art more near thy death than I am, for thou goest to the deathward, an God be not thy friend.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000214\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000214\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000215\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000215\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So as they went thus talking they came to the fountain, and the rich pavilion there by it. Then King Arthur was ware where sat a knight armed in a chair. Sir knight, said Arthur, for what cause abidest thou here, that there may no knight ride this way but if he joust with thee? said the king. I rede thee leave that custom, said Arthur. This custom, said the knight, have I used and will use maugre who saith nay, and who is grieved with my custom let him amend it that will. I will amend it, said Arthur. I shall defend thee, said the knight. Anon he took his horse and dressed his shield and took a spear, and they met so hard either in other’s shields, that all to-shivered their spears. Therewith anon Arthur pulled out his sword. Nay, not so, said the knight; it is fairer, said the knight, that we twain run more together with sharp spears. I will well, said Arthur, an I had any more spears. I have enow, said the knight; so there came a squire and brought two good spears, and Arthur chose one and he another; so they spurred their horses and came together with all their mights, that either brake their spears to their hands. Then Arthur set hand on his sword. Nay, said the knight, ye shall do better, ye are a passing good jouster as ever I met withal, and once for the love of the high order of knighthood let us joust once again. I assent me, said Arthur. Anon there were brought two great spears, and every knight gat a spear, and therewith they ran together that Arthur’s spear all to-shivered. But the other knight hit him so hard in midst of the shield, that horse and man fell to the earth, and therewith Arthur was eager, and pulled out his sword, and said, I will assay thee, sir knight, on foot, for I have lost the honour on horseback. I will be on horseback, said the knight. Then was Arthur wroth, and dressed his shield toward him with his sword drawn. When the knight saw that, he alighted, for him thought no worship to have a knight at such avail, he to be on horseback and he on foot, and so he alighted and dressed his shield unto Arthur. And there began a strong battle with many great strokes, and so hewed with their swords that the cantels flew in the fields, and much blood they bled both, that all the place there as they fought was overbled with blood, and thus they fought long and rested them, and then they went to the battle again, and so hurtled together like two rams that either fell to the earth. So at the last they smote together that both their swords met even together. But the sword of the knight smote King Arthur’s sword in two pieces, wherefore he was heavy. Then said the knight unto Arthur, Thou art in my daunger whether me list to save thee or slay thee, and but thou yield thee as overcome and recreant, thou shalt die. As for death, said King Arthur, welcome be it when it cometh, but to yield me unto thee as recreant I had liefer die than to be so shamed. And therewithal the king leapt unto Pellinore, and took him by the middle and threw him down, and raced off his helm. When the knight felt that he was adread, for he was a passing big man of might, and anon he brought Arthur under him, and raced off his helm and would have smitten off his head.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000216\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000216\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000217\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000217\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000218\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000218\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br>\\nHow Merlin saved Arthur’s life, and threw an enchantment on King Pellinore and made him to sleep.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000219\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000219\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000220\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000220\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Therewithal came Merlin and said, Knight, hold thy hand, for an thou slay that knight thou puttest this realm in the greatest damage that ever was realm: for this knight is a man of more worship than thou wotest of.

So the hermit searched all his wounds and gave him good salves; so the king was there three days, and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and go, and so departed. And as they rode, Arthur said, I have no sword. No force, said Merlin, hereby is a sword that shall be yours, an I may. So they rode till they came to a lake, the which was a fair water and broad, and in the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in that hand. Lo! said Merlin, yonder is that sword that I spake of. With that they saw a damosel going upon the lake. What damosel is that? said Arthur. That is the Lady of the Lake, said Merlin; and within that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on earth, and richly beseen; and this damosel will come to you anon, and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword. Anon withal came the damosel unto Arthur, and saluted him, and he her again. Damosel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder the arm holdeth above the water? I would it were mine, for I have no sword. Sir Arthur, king, said the damosel, that sword is mine, and if ye will give me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it. By my faith, said Arthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask. Well! said the damosel, go ye into yonder barge, and row yourself to the sword, and take it and the scabbard with you, and I will ask my gift when I see my time. So Sir Arthur and Merlin alighted and tied their horses to two trees, and so they went into the ship, and when they came to the sword that the hand held, Sir Arthur took it up by the handles, and took it with him, and the arm and the hand went under the water. And so [they] came unto the land and rode forth, and then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion. What signifieth yonder pavilion? It is the knight’s pavilion, said Merlin, that ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore; but he is out, he is not there. He hath ado with a knight of yours that hight Egglame, and they have foughten together, but at the last Egglame fled, and else he had been dead, and he hath chased him even to Carlion, and we shall meet with him anon in the highway. That is well said, said Arthur, now have I a sword, now will I wage battle with him, and be avenged on him. Sir, you shall not so, said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also he will not be lightly matched of one knight living, and therefore it is my counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in short time, and his sons after his days. Also ye shall see that day in short space, you shall be right glad to give him your sister to wed. When I see him, I will do as ye advise, said Arthur.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000226\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000226\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000227\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000227\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well.

So they rode unto Carlion, and by the way they met with Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had done such a craft, that Pellinore saw not Arthur, and he passed by without any words.

So they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights were passing glad. And when they heard of his adventures, they marvelled that he would jeopard his person so, alone.

But when the messenger came to King Rience, then was he wood out of measure, and purveyed him for a great host, as it rehearseth after in the book of Balin le Savage, that followeth next after, how by adventure Balin gat the sword.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000240\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000240\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000241\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000241\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h5>Explicit liber primus.</h5></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000242\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000242\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000243\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000243\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000244\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000244\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h2><a></a>BOOK II.</h2></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000245\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000245\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000246\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000246\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000247\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000247\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER I.<br>\\nOf a damosel which came girt with a sword for to find a man of such virtue to draw it out of the scabbard.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000248\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000248\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000249\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000249\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After the death of Uther Pendragon reigned Arthur his son, the which had great war in his days for to get all England into his hand.

And if I may find such a knight that hath all these virtues, he may draw out this sword out of the sheath, for I have been at King Rience’s it was told me there were passing good knights, and he and all his knights have assayed it and none can speed. This is a great marvel, said Arthur, if this be sooth; I will myself assay to draw out the sword, not presuming upon myself that I am the best knight, but that I will begin to draw at your sword in giving example to all the barons that they shall assay everych one after other when I have assayed it.

The name of this knight was called Balin, and by good means of the barons he was delivered out of prison, for he was a good man named of his body, and he was born in Northumberland. And so he went privily into the court, and saw this adventure, whereof it raised his heart, and he would assay it as other knights did, but for he was poor and poorly arrayed he put him not far in press. But in his heart he was fully assured to do as well, if his grace happed him, as any knight that there was. And as the damosel took her leave of Arthur and of all the barons, so departing, this knight Balin called unto her, and said, Damosel, I pray you of your courtesy, suffer me as well to assay as these lords; though that I be so poorly clothed, in my heart meseemeth I am fully assured as some of these others, and meseemeth in my heart to speed right well. The damosel beheld the poor knight, and saw he was a likely man, but for his poor arrayment she thought he should be of no worship without villainy or treachery. And then she said unto the knight, Sir, it needeth not to put me to more pain or labour, for it seemeth not you to speed there as other have failed. Ah! fair damosel, said Balin, worthiness, and good tatches, and good deeds, are not only in arrayment, but manhood and worship is hid within man’s person, and many a worshipful knight is not known unto all people, and therefore worship and hardiness is not in arrayment. By God, said the damosel, ye say sooth; therefore ye shall assay to do what ye may. Then Balin took the sword by the girdle and sheath, and drew it out easily; and when he looked on the sword it pleased him much. Then had the king and all the barons great marvel that Balin had done that adventure, and many knights had great despite of Balin. Certes, said the damosel, this is a passing good knight, and the best that ever I found, and most of worship without treason, treachery, or villainy, and many marvels shall he do. Now, gentle and courteous knight, give me the sword again. Nay, said Balin, for this sword will I keep, but it be taken from me with force. Well, said the damosel, ye are not wise to keep the sword from me, for ye shall slay with the sword the best friend that ye have, and the man that ye most love in the world, and the sword shall be your destruction. I shall take the adventure, said Balin, that God will ordain me, but the sword ye shall not have at this time, by the faith of my body. Ye shall repent it within short time, said the damosel, for I would have the sword more for your avail than for mine, for I am passing heavy for your sake; for ye will not believe that sword shall be your destruction, and that is great pity. With that the damosel departed, making great sorrow.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000259\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000259\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000260\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000260\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Anon after, Balin sent for his horse and armour, and so would depart from the court, and took his leave of King Arthur.

And she came on horseback, richly beseen, and saluted King Arthur, and there asked him a gift that he promised her when she gave him the sword. That is sooth, said Arthur, a gift I promised you, but I have forgotten the name of my sword that ye gave me. The name of it, said the lady, is Excalibur, that is as much to say as Cut-steel. Ye say well, said the king; ask what ye will and ye shall have it, an it lie in my power to give it. Well, said the lady, I ask the head of the knight that hath won the sword, or else the damosel’s head that brought it; I take no force though I have both their heads, for he slew my brother, a good knight and a true, and that gentlewoman was causer of my father’s death. Truly, said King Arthur, I may not grant neither of their heads with my worship, therefore ask what ye will else, and I shall fulfil your desire. I will ask none other thing, said the lady. When Balin was ready to depart, he saw the Lady of the Lake, that by her means had slain Balin’s mother, and he had sought her three years; and when it was told him that she asked his head of King Arthur, he went to her straight and said, Evil be you found; ye would have my head, and therefore ye shall lose yours, and with his sword lightly he smote off her head before King Arthur. Alas, for shame! said Arthur, why have ye done so? ye have shamed me and all my court, for this was a lady that I was beholden to, and hither she came under my safe-conduct; I shall never forgive you that trespass. Sir, said Balin, me forthinketh of your displeasure, for this same lady was the untruest lady living, and by enchantment and sorcery she hath been the destroyer of many good knights, and she was causer that my mother was burnt, through her falsehood and treachery. What cause soever ye had, said Arthur, ye should have forborne her in my presence; therefore, think not the contrary, ye shall repent it, for such another despite had I never in my court; therefore withdraw you out of my court in all haste ye may.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000266\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000266\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000267\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000267\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then Balin took up the head of the lady, and bare it with him to his hostelry, and there he met with his squire, that was sorry he had displeased King Arthur and so they rode forth out of the town.

And therewith she took the sword from her love that lay dead, and fell to the ground in a swoon. And when she arose she made great dole out of measure, the which sorrow grieved Balin passingly sore, and he went unto her for to have taken the sword out of her hand, but she held it so fast he might not take it out of her hand unless he should have hurt her, and suddenly she set the pommel to the ground, and rove herself through the body. When Balin espied her deeds, he was passing heavy in his heart, and ashamed that so fair a damosel had destroyed herself for the love of his death. Alas, said Balin, me repenteth sore the death of this knight, for the love of this damosel, for there was much true love betwixt them both, and for sorrow might not longer behold him, but turned his horse and looked toward a great forest, and there he was ware, by the arms, of his brother Balan. And when they were met they put off their helms and kissed together, and wept for joy and pity. Then Balan said, I little weened to have met with you at this sudden adventure; I am right glad of your deliverance out of your dolorous prisonment, for a man told me, in the castle of Four Stones, that ye were delivered, and that man had seen you in the court of King Arthur, and therefore I came hither into this country, for here I supposed to find you. Anon the knight Balin told his brother of his adventure of the sword, and of the death of the Lady of the Lake, and how King Arthur was displeased with him. Wherefore he sent this knight after me, that lieth here dead, and the death of this damosel grieveth me sore. So doth it me, said Balan, but ye must take the adventure that God will ordain you. Truly, said Balin, I am right heavy that my Lord Arthur is displeased with me, for he is the most worshipful knight that reigneth now on earth, and his love will I get or else will I put my life in adventure. For the King Rience lieth at a siege at the Castle Terrabil, and thither will we draw in all haste, to prove our worship and prowess upon him. I will well, said Balan, that we do, and we will help each other as brethren ought to do.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000285\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000285\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000286\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000286\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000287\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000287\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>\\nHow a dwarf reproved Balin for the death of Lanceor, and how King Mark of Cornwall found them, and made a tomb over them.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000288\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000288\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000289\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000289\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Now go we hence, said Balin, and well be we met. The meanwhile as they talked, there came a dwarf from the city of Camelot on horseback, as much as he might; and found the dead bodies, wherefore he made great dole, and pulled out his hair for sorrow, and said, Which of you knights have done this deed? Whereby askest thou it? said Balan. For I would wit it, said the dwarf. It was I, said Balin, that slew this knight in my defence, for hither he came to chase me, and either I must slay him or he me; and this damosel slew herself for his love, which repenteth me, and for her sake I shall owe all women the better love. Alas, said the dwarf, thou hast done great damage unto thyself, for this knight that is here dead was one of the most valiantest men that lived, and trust well, Balin, the kin of this knight will chase you through the world till they have slain you. As for that, said Balin, I fear not greatly, but I am right heavy that I have displeased my lord King Arthur, for the death of this knight. So as they talked together, there came a king of Cornwall riding, the which hight King Mark. And when he saw these two bodies dead, and understood how they were dead, by the two knights above said, then made the king great sorrow for the true love that was betwixt them, and said, I will not depart till I have on this earth made a tomb, and there he pight his pavilions and sought through all the country to find a tomb, and in a church they found one was fair and rich, and then the king let put them both in the earth, and put the tomb upon them, and wrote the names of them both on the tomb. How here lieth Lanceor the king’s son of Ireland, that at his own request was slain by the hands of Balin; and how his lady, Colombe, and paramour, slew herself with her love’s sword for dole and sorrow.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000290\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000290\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000291\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000291\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000292\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000292\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>\\nHow Merlin prophesied that two the best knights of the world should fight there, which were Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000293\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000293\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000294\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000294\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The meanwhile as this was a-doing, in came Merlin to King Mark, and seeing all his doing, said, Here shall be in this same place the greatest battle betwixt two knights that was or ever shall be, and the truest lovers, and yet none of them shall slay other. And there Merlin wrote their names upon the tomb with letters of gold that should fight in that place, whose names were Launcelot de Lake, and Tristram. Thou art a marvellous man, said King Mark unto Merlin, that speakest of such marvels, thou art a boistous man and an unlikely to tell of such deeds. What is thy name? said King Mark. At this time, said Merlin, I will not tell, but at that time when Sir Tristram is taken with his sovereign lady, then ye shall hear and know my name, and at that time ye shall hear tidings that shall not please you. Then said Merlin to Balin, Thou hast done thyself great hurt, because that thou savest not this lady that slew herself, that might have saved her an thou wouldest. By the faith of my body, said Balin, I might not save her, for she slew herself suddenly. Me repenteth, said Merlin; because of the death of that lady thou shalt strike a stroke most dolorous that ever man struck, except the stroke of our Lord, for thou shalt hurt the truest knight and the man of most worship that now liveth, and through that stroke three kingdoms shall be in great poverty, misery and wretchedness twelve years, and the knight shall not be whole of that wound for many years. Then Merlin took his leave of Balin. And Balin said, If I wist it were sooth that ye say I should do such a perilous deed as that, I would slay myself to make thee a liar. Therewith Merlin vanished away suddenly. And then Balan and his brother took their leave of King Mark. First, said the king, tell me your name. Sir, said Balan, ye may see he beareth two swords, thereby ye may call him the Knight with the Two Swords. And so departed King Mark unto Camelot to King Arthur, and Balin took the way toward King Rience; and as they rode together they met with Merlin disguised, but they knew him not. Whither ride you? said Merlin. We have little to do, said the two knights, to tell thee. But what is thy name? said Balin. At this time, said Merlin, I will not tell it thee. It is evil seen, said the knights, that thou art a true man that thou wilt not tell thy name. As for that, said Merlin, be it as it be may, I can tell you wherefore ye ride this way, for to meet King Rience; but it will not avail you without ye have my counsel. Ah! said Balin, ye are Merlin; we will be ruled by your counsel. Come on, said Merlin, ye shall have great worship, and look that ye do knightly, for ye shall have great need.

Sir, said the king, the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother, which are two marvellous knights of prowess. I know them not, said Arthur, but much I am beholden to them. Ah, said Merlin, I shall tell you: it is Balin that achieved the sword, and his brother Balan, a good knight, there liveth not a better of prowess and of worthiness, and it shall be the greatest dole of him that ever I knew of knight, for he shall not long endure.

Alas, said King Lot, I am ashamed, for by my default there is many a worshipful man slain, for an we had been together there had been none host under the heaven that had been able for to have matched with us; this faiter with his prophecy hath mocked me. All that did Merlin, for he knew well that an King Lot had been with his body there at the first battle, King Arthur had been slain, and all his people destroyed; and well Merlin knew that one of the kings should be dead that day, and loath was Merlin that any of them both should be slain; but of the twain, he had liefer King Lot had been slain than King Arthur. Now what is best to do? said King Lot of Orkney; whether is me better to treat with King Arthur or to fight, for the greater part of our people are slain and destroyed? Sir, said a knight, set on Arthur for they are weary and forfoughten and we be fresh. As for me, said King Lot, I would every knight would do his part as I would do mine. And then they advanced banners and smote together and all to-shivered their spears; and Arthur’s knights, with the help of the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother Balan put King Lot and his host to the worse. But always King Lot held him in the foremost front, and did marvellous deeds of arms, for all his host was borne up by his hands, for he abode all knights. Alas he might not endure, the which was great pity, that so worthy a knight as he was one should be overmatched, that of late time afore had been a knight of King Arthur’s, and wedded the sister of King Arthur; and for King Arthur lay by King Lot’s wife, the which was Arthur’s sister, and gat on her Mordred, therefore King Lot held against Arthur. So there was a knight that was called the Knight with the Strange Beast, and at that time his right name was called Pellinore, the which was a good man of prowess, and he smote a mighty stroke at King Lot as he fought with all his enemies, and he failed of his stroke, and smote the horse’s neck, that he fell to the ground with King Lot. And therewith anon Pellinore smote him a great stroke through the helm and head unto the brows. And then all the host of Orkney fled for the death of King Lot, and there were slain many mothers’ sons. But King Pellinore bare the wite of the death of King Lot, wherefore Sir Gawaine revenged the death of his father the tenth year after he was made knight, and slew King Pellinore with his own hands. Also there were slain at that battle twelve kings on the side of King Lot with Nero, and all were buried in the Church of Saint Stephen’s in Camelot, and the remnant of knights and of others were buried in a great rock.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000309\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000309\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000310\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000310\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000311\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000311\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>\\nOf the interment of twelve kings, and of the prophecy of Merlin, and how Balin should give the dolorous stroke.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000312\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000312\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000313\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000313\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So at the interment came King Lot’s wife Margawse with her four sons, Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Gareth. Also there came thither King Uriens, Sir Ewaine’s father, and Morgan le Fay his wife that was King Arthur’s sister. All these came to the interment. But of all these twelve kings King Arthur let make the tomb of King Lot passing richly, and made his tomb by his own; and then Arthur let make twelve images of latten and copper, and over-gilt it with gold, in the sign of twelve kings, and each one of them held a taper of wax that burnt day and night; and King Arthur was made in sign of a figure standing above them with a sword drawn in his hand, and all the twelve figures had countenance like unto men that were overcome. All this made Merlin by his subtle craft, and there he told the king, When I am dead these tapers shall burn no longer, and soon after the adventures of the Sangreal shall come among you and be achieved. Also he told Arthur how Balin the worshipful knight shall give the dolorous stroke, whereof shall fall great vengeance. Oh, where is Balin and Balan and Pellinore? said King Arthur. As for Pellinore, said Merlin, he will meet with you soon; and as for Balin he will not be long from you; but the other brother will depart, ye shall see him no more. By my faith, said Arthur, they are two marvellous knights, and namely Balin passeth of prowess of any knight that ever I found, for much beholden am I unto him; would God he would abide with me. Sir, said Merlin, look ye keep well the scabbard of Excalibur, for ye shall lose no blood while ye have the scabbard upon you, though ye have as many wounds upon you as ye may have. So after, for great trust, Arthur betook the scabbard to Morgan le Fay his sister, and she loved another knight better than her husband King Uriens or King Arthur, and she would have had Arthur her brother slain, and therefore she let make another scabbard like it by enchantment, and gave the scabbard Excalibur to her love; and the knight’s name was called Accolon, that after had near slain King Arthur. After this Merlin told unto King Arthur of the prophecy that there should be a great battle beside Salisbury, and Mordred his own son should be against him.

Right so he heard a great noise of an horse, and therewith the king looked out at the porch of the pavilion, and saw a knight coming even by him, making great dole. Abide, fair sir, said Arthur, and tell me wherefore thou makest this sorrow. Ye may little amend me, said the knight, and so passed forth to the castle of Meliot. Anon after there came Balin, and when he saw King Arthur he alighted off his horse, and came to the King on foot, and saluted him. By my head, said Arthur, ye be welcome. Sir, right now came riding this way a knight making great mourn, for what cause I cannot tell; wherefore I would desire of you of your courtesy and of your gentleness to fetch again that knight either by force or else by his good will. I will do more for your lordship than that, said Balin; and so he rode more than a pace, and found the knight with a damosel in a forest, and said, Sir knight, ye must come with me unto King Arthur, for to tell him of your sorrow. That will I not, said the knight, for it will scathe me greatly, and do you none avail. Sir, said Balin, I pray you make you ready, for ye must go with me, or else I must fight with you and bring you by force, and that were me loath to do. Will ye be my warrant, said the knight, an I go with you? Yea, said Balin, or else I will die therefore. And so he made him ready to go with Balin, and left the damosel still. And as they were even afore King Arthur’s pavilion, there came one invisible, and smote this knight that went with Balin throughout the body with a spear. Alas, said the knight, I am slain under your conduct with a knight called Garlon; therefore take my horse that is better than yours, and ride to the damosel, and follow the quest that I was in as she will lead you, and revenge my death when ye may. That shall I do, said Balin, and that I make vow unto knighthood; and so he departed from this knight with great sorrow. So King Arthur let bury this knight richly, and made a mention on his tomb, how there was slain Herlews le Berbeus, and by whom the treachery was done, the knight Garlon.

Anon after this Balin and the damosel rode till they came to a castle, and there Balin alighted, and he and the damosel went to go into the castle, and anon as Balin came within the castle’s gate the portcullis fell down at his back, and there fell many men about the damosel, and would have slain her. When Balin saw that, he was sore aggrieved, for he might not help the damosel. Then he went up into the tower, and leapt over walls into the ditch, and hurt him not; and anon he pulled out his sword and would have foughten with them. And they all said nay, they would not fight with him, for they did nothing but the old custom of the castle; and told him how their lady was sick, and had lain many years, and she might not be whole but if she had a dish of silver full of blood of a clean maid and a king’s daughter; and therefore the custom of this castle is, there shall no damosel pass this way but she shall bleed of her blood in a silver dish full. Well, said Balin, she shall bleed as much as she may bleed, but I will not lose the life of her whiles my life lasteth. And so Balin made her to bleed by her good will, but her blood helped not the lady. And so he and she rested there all night, and had there right good cheer, and on the morn they passed on their ways. And as it telleth after in the Sangreal, that Sir Percivale’s sister helped that lady with her blood, whereof she was dead.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000324\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000324\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000325\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000325\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000326\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000326\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>\\nHow Balin met with that knight named Garlon at a feast, and there he slew him, to have his blood to heal therewith the son of his host.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000327\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000327\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000328\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000328\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then they rode three or four days and never met with adventure, and by hap they were lodged with a gentle man that was a rich man and well at ease. And as they sat at their supper Balin overheard one complain grievously by him in a chair. What is this noise? said Balin. Forsooth, said his host, I will tell you. I was but late at a jousting, and there I jousted with a knight that is brother unto King Pellam, and twice smote I him down, and then he promised to quit me on my best friend; and so he wounded my son, that cannot be whole till I have of that knight’s blood, and he rideth alway invisible; but I know not his name. Ah! said Balin, I know that knight, his name is Garlon, he hath slain two knights of mine in the same manner, therefore I had liefer meet with that knight than all the gold in this realm, for the despite he hath done me. Well, said his host, I shall tell you, King Pellam of Listeneise hath made do cry in all this country a great feast that shall be within these twenty days, and no knight may come there but if he bring his wife with him, or his paramour; and that knight, your enemy and mine, ye shall see that day. Then I behote you, said Balin, part of his blood to heal your son withal. We will be forward to-morn, said his host. So on the morn they rode all three toward Pellam, and they had fifteen days’ journey or they came thither; and that same day began the great feast. And so they alighted and stabled their horses, and went into the castle; but Balin’s host might not be let in because he had no lady. Then Balin was well received and brought unto a chamber and unarmed him; and there were brought him robes to his pleasure, and would have had Balin leave his sword behind him. Nay, said Balin, that do I not, for it is the custom of my country a knight always to keep his weapon with him, and that custom will I keep, or else I will depart as I came. Then they gave him leave to wear his sword, and so he went unto the castle, and was set among knights of worship, and his lady afore him.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000329\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000329\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000330\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000330\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Soon Balin asked a knight, Is there not a knight in this court whose name is Garlon?

Then King Pellam caught in his hand a grim weapon and smote eagerly at Balin; but Balin put the sword betwixt his head and the stroke, and therewith his sword burst in sunder.

And when Balin saw that spear, he gat it in his hand and turned him to King Pellam, and smote him passingly sore with that spear, that King Pellam fell down in a swoon, and therewith the castle roof and walls brake and fell to the earth, and Balin fell down so that he might not stir foot nor hand.

And at the last he came into a fair forest in a valley, and was ware of a tower, and there beside he saw a great horse of war, tied to a tree, and there beside sat a fair knight on the ground and made great mourning, and he was a likely man, and a well made. Balin said, God save you, why be ye so heavy? tell me and I will amend it, an I may, to my power. Sir knight, said he again, thou dost me great grief, for I was in merry thoughts, and now thou puttest me to more pain. Balin went a little from him, and looked on his horse; then heard Balin him say thus: Ah, fair lady, why have ye broken my promise, for thou promisest me to meet me here by noon, and I may curse thee that ever ye gave me this sword, for with this sword I slay myself, and pulled it out. And therewith Balin stert unto him and took him by the hand. Let go my hand, said the knight, or else I shall slay thee. That shall not need, said Balin, for I shall promise you my help to get you your lady, an ye will tell me where she is. What is your name? said the knight. My name is Balin le Savage. Ah, sir, I know you well enough, ye are the Knight with the Two Swords, and the man of most prowess of your hands living. What is your name? said Balin. My name is Garnish of the Mount, a poor man’s son, but by my prowess and hardiness a duke hath made me knight, and gave me lands; his name is Duke Hermel, and his daughter is she that I love, and she me as I deemed. How far is she hence? said Balin. But six mile, said the knight. Now ride we hence, said these two knights. So they rode more than a pace, till that they came to a fair castle well walled and ditched. I will into the castle, said Balin, and look if she be there. So he went in and searched from chamber to chamber, and found her bed, but she was not there. Then Balin looked into a fair little garden, and under a laurel tree he saw her lie upon a quilt of green samite and a knight in her arms, fast halsing either other, and under their heads grass and herbs. When Balin saw her lie so with the foulest knight that ever he saw, and she a fair lady, then Balin went through all the chambers again, and told the knight how he found her as she had slept fast, and so brought him in the place there she lay fast sleeping.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000343\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000343\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000344\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000344\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000345\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000345\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>\\nHow that knight slew his love and a knight lying by her, and after, how he slew himself with his own sword, and how Balin rode toward a castle where he lost his life.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000346\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000346\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000347\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000347\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And when Garnish beheld her so lying, for pure sorrow his mouth and nose burst out a-bleeding, and with his sword he smote off both their heads, and then he made sorrow out of measure, and said, O Balin, much sorrow hast thou brought unto me, for hadst thou not shewed me that sight I should have passed my sorrow. Forsooth, said Balin, I did it to this intent that it should better thy courage, and that ye might see and know her falsehood, and to cause you to leave love of such a lady; God knoweth I did none other but as I would ye did to me.

And he vanished away anon; and so he heard an horn blow as it had been the death of a beast. That blast, said Balin, is blown for me, for I am the prize and yet am I not dead.

Also Merlin let make there a bed, that there should never man lie therein but he went out of his wit, yet Launcelot de Lake fordid that bed through his noblesse. And anon after Balin was dead, Merlin took his sword, and took off the pommel and set on another pommel. So Merlin bade a knight that stood afore him handle that sword, and he assayed, and he might not handle it. Then Merlin laughed. Why laugh ye? said the knight. This is the cause, said Merlin: there shall never man handle this sword but the best knight of the world, and that shall be Sir Launcelot or else Galahad his son, and Launcelot with this sword shall slay the man that in the world he loved best, that shall be Sir Gawaine. All this he let write in the pommel of the sword. Then Merlin let make a bridge of iron and of steel into that island, and it was but half a foot broad, and there shall never man pass that bridge, nor have hardiness to go over, but if he were a passing good man and a good knight without treachery or villainy. Also the scabbard of Balin’s sword Merlin left it on this side the island, that Galahad should find it. Also Merlin let make by his subtilty that Balin’s sword was put in a marble stone standing upright as great as a mill stone, and the stone hoved always above the water and did many years, and so by adventure it swam down the stream to the City of Camelot, that is in English Winchester. And that same day Galahad the haut prince came with King Arthur, and so Galahad brought with him the scabbard and achieved the sword that was there in the marble stone hoving upon the water.

Yea, said King Arthur, I love Guenever the king’s daughter, Leodegrance of the land of Cameliard, the which holdeth in his house the Table Round that ye told he had of my father Uther.

Yonder he is, said the knights, wilt thou anything with him? Yea, said the poor man, therefore I came hither. Anon as he came before the king, he saluted him and said: O King Arthur, the flower of all knights and kings, I beseech Jesu save thee. Sir, it was told me that at this time of your marriage ye would give any man the gift that he would ask, out except that were unreasonable. That is truth, said the king, such cries I let make, and that will I hold, so it apair not my realm nor mine estate. Ye say well and graciously, said the poor man; Sir, I ask nothing else but that ye will make my son here a knight. It is a great thing thou askest of me, said the king. What is thy name? said the king to the poor man. Sir, my name is Aries the cowherd. Whether cometh this of thee or of thy son? said the king. Nay, sir, said Aries, this desire cometh of my son and not of me, for I shall tell you I have thirteen sons, and all they will fall to what labour I put them, and will be right glad to do labour, but this child will not labour for me, for anything that my wife or I may do, but always he will be shooting or casting darts, and glad for to see battles and to behold knights, and always day and night he desireth of me to be made a knight. What is thy name? said the king unto the young man. Sir, my name is Tor. The king beheld him fast, and saw he was passingly well-visaged and passingly well made of his years. Well, said King Arthur unto Aries the cowherd, fetch all thy sons afore me that I may see them. And so the poor man did, and all were shaped much like the poor man.

Now Merlin, said Arthur, say whether this Tor shall be a good knight or no. Yea, sir, he ought to be a good knight, for he is come of as good a man as any is alive, and of kings’ blood. How so, sir? said the king. I shall tell you, said Merlin: This poor man, Aries the cowherd, is not his father; he is nothing sib to him, for King Pellinore is his father. I suppose nay, said the cowherd. Fetch thy wife afore me, said Merlin, and she shall not say nay. Anon the wife was fetched, which was a fair housewife, and there she answered Merlin full womanly, and there she told the king and Merlin that when she was a maid, and went to milk kine, there met with her a stern knight, and half by force he had my maidenhead, and at that time he begat my son Tor, and he took away from me my greyhound that I had that time with me, and said that he would keep the greyhound for my love. Ah, said the cowherd, I weened not this, but I may believe it well, for he had never no tatches of me. Sir, said Tor unto Merlin, dishonour not my mother. Sir, said Merlin, it is more for your worship than hurt, for your father is a good man and a king, and he may right well advance you and your mother, for ye were begotten or ever she was wedded.

Not good, said he. It is your own default, said the lady, for ye have done a passing foul deed in the slaying of the lady, the which will be great villainy unto you. But be ye not of King Arthur’s kin? said the lady. Yes truly, said Sir Gawaine. What is your name? said the lady, ye must tell it me or ye pass. My name is Gawaine, the King Lot of Orkney’s son, and my mother is King Arthur’s sister. Ah! then are ye nephew unto King Arthur, said the lady, and I shall so speak for you that ye shall have conduct to go to King Arthur for his love. And so she departed and told the four knights how their prisoner was King Arthur’s nephew, and his name is Sir Gawaine, King Lot’s son of Orkney. And they gave him the hart’s head because it was in his quest. Then anon they delivered Sir Gawaine under this promise, that he should bear the dead lady with him in this manner; the head of her was hanged about his neck, and the whole body of her lay before him on his horse’s mane. Right so rode he forth unto Camelot. And anon as he was come, Merlin desired of King Arthur that Sir Gawaine should be sworn to tell of all his adventures, and how he slew the lady, and how he would give no mercy unto the knight, wherethrough the lady was slain. Then the king and the queen were greatly displeased with Sir Gawaine for the slaying of the lady. And there by ordinance of the queen there was set a quest of ladies on Sir Gawaine, and they judged him for ever while he lived to be with all ladies, and to fight for their quarrels; and that ever he should be courteous, and never to refuse mercy to him that asketh mercy. Thus was Gawaine sworn upon the Four Evangelists that he should never be against lady nor gentlewoman, but if he fought for a lady and his adversary fought for another. And thus endeth the adventure of Sir Gawaine that he did at the marriage of King Arthur.

Then there came one armed on horseback, and dressed his shield, and came fast toward Tor, and he dressed him against him, and so ran together that Tor bare him from his horse. And anon the knight yielded him to his mercy. But, sir, I have a fellow in yonder pavilion that will have ado with you anon. He shall be welcome, said Sir Tor. Then was he ware of another knight coming with great raundon, and each of them dressed to other, that marvel it was to see; but the knight smote Sir Tor a great stroke in midst of the shield that his spear all to-shivered. And Sir Tor smote him through the shield below of the shield that it went through the cost of the knight, but the stroke slew him not. And therewith Sir Tor alighted and smote him on the helm a great stroke, and therewith the knight yielded him and besought him of mercy. I will well, said Sir Tor, but thou and thy fellow must go unto King Arthur, and yield you prisoners unto him. By whom shall we say are we thither sent? Ye shall say by the knight that went in the quest of the knight that went with the brachet. Now, what be your two names? said Sir Tor. My name is, said the one, Sir Felot of Langduk; and my name is, said the other, Sir Petipase of Winchelsea. Now go ye forth, said Sir Tor, and God speed you and me. Then came the dwarf and said unto Sir Tor, I pray you give me a gift. I will well, said Sir Tor, ask.

Now, said the damosel, he may not, for he slew mine own brother before mine own eyes, that was a better knight than he, an he had had grace; and I kneeled half an hour afore him in the mire for to save my brother’s life, that had done him no damage, but fought with him by adventure of arms, and so for all that I could do he struck off his head; wherefore I require thee, as thou art a true knight, to give me my gift, or else I shall shame thee in all the court of King Arthur; for he is the falsest knight living, and a great destroyer of good knights.

And on the morn he heard his mass, and brake his fast, and took his leave of the knight and of the lady, that besought him to tell them his name.

O fair knight, said the lady and her husband, an ye come here in our marches, come and see our poor lodging, and it shall be always at your commandment. So Sir Tor departed and came to Camelot on the third day by noon, and the king and the queen and all the court was passing fain of his coming, and made great joy that he was come again; for he went from the court with little succour, but as King Pellinore his father gave him an old courser, and King Arthur gave him armour and a sword, and else had he none other succour, but rode so forth himself alone. And then the king and the queen by Merlin’s advice made him to swear to tell of his adventures, and so he told and made proofs of his deeds as it is afore rehearsed, wherefore the king and the queen made great joy. Nay, nay, said Merlin, these be but japes to that he shall do; for he shall prove a noble knight of prowess, as good as any is living, and gentle and courteous, and of good tatches, and passing true of his promise, and never shall outrage. Wherethrough Merlin’s words King Arthur gave him an earldom of lands that fell unto him.

So King Pellinore gave him such a stroke upon the helm that he clave the head down to the chin, that he fell to the earth dead.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000449\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000449\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000450\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000450\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000451\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000451\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>\\nHow King Pellinore gat the lady and brought her to Camelot to the court of King Arthur.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000452\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000452\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000453\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000453\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then he turned him to the other knight, that was sore wounded. But when he saw the other’s buffet, he would not fight, but kneeled down and said, Take my cousin the lady with you at your request, and I require you, as ye be a true knight, put her to no shame nor villainy. What, said King Pellinore, will ye not fight for her? No, sir, said the knight, I will not fight with such a knight of prowess as ye be. Well, said Pellinore, ye say well; I promise you she shall have no villainy by me, as I am true knight; but now me lacketh an horse, said Pellinore, but I will have Hontzlake’s horse. Ye shall not need, said the knight, for I shall give you such an horse as shall please you, so that you will lodge with me, for it is near night. I will well, said King Pellinore, abide with you all night. And there he had with him right good cheer, and fared of the best with passing good wine, and had merry rest that night. And on the morn he heard a mass and dined; and then was brought him a fair bay courser, and King Pellinore’s saddle set upon him. Now, what shall I call you? said the knight, inasmuch as ye have my cousin at your desire of your quest. Sir, I shall tell you, my name is King Pellinore of the Isles and knight of the Table Round. Now I am glad, said the knight, that such a noble man shall have the rule of my cousin. Now, what is your name? said Pellinore, I pray you tell me. Sir, my name is Sir Meliot of Logurs, and this lady my cousin hight Nimue, and the knight that was in the other pavilion is my sworn brother, a passing good knight, and his name is Brian of the Isles, and he is full loath to do wrong, and full loath to fight with any man, but if he be sore sought on, so that for shame he may not leave it. It is marvel, said Pellinore, that he will not have ado with me. Sir, he will not have ado with no man but if it be at his request. Bring him to the court, said Pellinore, one of these days. Sir, we will come together. And ye shall be welcome, said Pellinore, to the court of King Arthur, and greatly allowed for your coming.

So right even afore him there met two knights, the one came froward Camelot, and the other from the north, and either saluted other. What tidings at Camelot? said the one. By my head, said the other, there have I been and espied the court of King Arthur, and there is such a fellowship they may never be broken, and well-nigh all the world holdeth with Arthur, for there is the flower of chivalry. Now for this cause I am riding into the north, to tell our chieftains of the fellowship that is withholden with King Arthur. As for that, said the other knight, I have brought a remedy with me, that is the greatest poison that ever ye heard speak of, and to Camelot will I with it, for we have a friend right nigh King Arthur, and well cherished, that shall poison King Arthur; for so he hath promised our chieftains, and received great gifts for to do it. Beware, said the other knight, of Merlin, for he knoweth all things by the devil’s craft. Therefore will I not let it, said the knight. And so they departed asunder. Anon after Pellinore made him ready, and his lady, [and] rode toward Camelot; and as they came by the well there as the wounded knight was and the lady, there he found the knight, and the lady eaten with lions or wild beasts, all save the head, wherefore he made great sorrow, and wept passing sore, and said, Alas! her life might I have saved; but I was so fierce in my quest, therefore I would not abide. Wherefore make ye such dole? said the lady. I wot not, said Pellinore, but my heart mourneth sore of the death of her, for she was a passing fair lady and a young. Now, will ye do by mine advice? said the lady, take this knight and let him be buried in an hermitage, and then take the lady’s head and bear it with you unto Arthur. So King Pellinore took this dead knight on his shoulders, and brought him to the hermitage, and charged the hermit with the corpse, that service should be done for the soul; and take his harness for your pain. It shall be done, said the hermit, as I will answer unto God.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000461\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000461\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000462\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000462\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000463\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000463\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>\\nHow when he was come to Camelot he was sworn upon a book to tell the truth of his quest.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000464\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000464\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000465\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000465\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And therewith they departed, and came there as the head of the lady lay with a fair yellow hair that grieved King Pellinore passingly sore when he looked on it, for much he cast his heart on the visage.

But Merlin would let her have no rest, but always he would be with her. And ever she made Merlin good cheer till she had learned of him all manner thing that she desired; and he was assotted upon her, that he might not be from her. So on a time he told King Arthur that he should not dure long, but for all his crafts he should be put in the earth quick. And so he told the king many things that should befall, but always he warned the king to keep well his sword and the scabbard, for he told him how the sword and the scabbard should be stolen by a woman from him that he most trusted. Also he told King Arthur that he should miss him,—Yet had ye liefer than all your lands to have me again. Ah, said the king, since ye know of your adventure, purvey for it, and put away by your crafts that misadventure. Nay, said Merlin, it will not be; so he departed from the king. And within a while the Damosel of the Lake departed, and Merlin went with her evermore wheresomever she went. And ofttimes Merlin would have had her privily away by his subtle crafts; then she made him to swear that he should never do none enchantment upon her if he would have his will. And so he sware; so she and Merlin went over the sea unto the land of Benwick, whereas King Ban was king that had great war against King Claudas, and there Merlin spake with King Ban’s wife, a fair lady and a good, and her name was Elaine, and there he saw young Launcelot. There the queen made great sorrow for the mortal war that King Claudas made on her lord and on her lands. Take none heaviness, said Merlin, for this same child within this twenty year shall revenge you on King Claudas, that all Christendom shall speak of it; and this same child shall be the most man of worship of the world, and his first name is Galahad, that know I well, said Merlin, and since ye have confirmed him Launcelot.

Now shall I never rest till I meet with those kings in a fair field, that I make mine avow; for my true liege people shall not be destroyed in my default, go with me who will, and abide who that will. Then the king let write unto King Pellinore, and prayed him in all haste to make him ready with such people as he might lightliest rear and hie him after in all haste. All the barons were privily wroth that the king would depart so suddenly; but the king by no mean would abide, but made writing unto them that were not there, and bade them hie after him, such as were not at that time in the court. Then the king came to Queen Guenever, and said, Lady, make you ready, for ye shall go with me, for I may not long miss you; ye shall cause me to be the more hardy, what adventure so befall me; I will not wit my lady to be in no jeopardy. Sir, said she, I am at your commandment, and shall be ready what time so ye be ready. So on the morn the king and the queen departed with such fellowship as they had, and came into the north, into a forest beside Humber, and there lodged them. When the word and tiding came unto the five kings above said, that Arthur was beside Humber in a forest, there was a knight, brother unto one of the five kings, that gave them this counsel: Ye know well that Sir Arthur hath the flower of chivalry of the world with him, as it is proved by the great battle he did with the eleven kings; and therefore hie unto him night and day till that we be nigh him, for the longer he tarrieth the bigger he is, and we ever the weaker; and he is so courageous of himself that he is come to the field with little people, and therefore let us set upon him or day and we shall slay down; of his knights there shall none escape.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000485\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000485\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000486\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000486\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000487\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000487\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER III.<br>\\nHow King Arthur had ado with them and overthrew them, and slew the five kings and made the remnant to flee.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000488\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000488\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000489\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000489\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Unto this counsel these five kings assented, and so they passed forth with their host through North Wales, and came upon Arthur by night, and set upon his host as the king and his knights were in their pavilions.

We shall have no need, said Sir Gawaine and Sir Griflet, that lay in a little pavilion by the king. With that they heard a great noise, and many cried, Treason, treason! Alas, said King Arthur, we be betrayed! Unto arms, fellows, then he cried. So they were armed anon at all points. Then came there a wounded knight unto the king, and said, Sir, save yourself and my lady the queen, for our host is destroyed, and much people of ours slain.

No force, said Sir Kay, I will undertake for two of them, and then may ye three undertake for the other three.

The king thanked them fair. Therewithal they led the king and his two fellows into a fair chamber, and there was a cloth laid, richly beseen of all that longed unto a table, and there were they served of all wines and meats that they could think; of that the king had great marvel, for he fared never better in his life as for one supper. And so when they had supped at their leisure, King Arthur was led into a chamber, a richer beseen chamber saw he never none, and so was King Uriens served, and led into such another chamber, and Sir Accolon was led into the third chamber passing richly and well beseen; and so they were laid in their beds easily. And anon they fell asleep, and slept marvellously sore all the night. And on the morrow King Uriens was in Camelot abed in his wife’s arms, Morgan le Fay.

And this Sir Damas, our master is as evil beloved, for he is without mercy, and he is a coward, and great war hath been betwixt them both, but Ontzlake hath ever the better, and ever he proffereth Sir Damas to fight for the livelihood, body for body, but he will not do; other-else to find a knight to fight for him. Unto that Sir Damas had granted to find a knight, but he is so evil beloved and hated, that there is never a knight will fight for him. And when Damas saw this, that there was never a knight would fight for him, he hath daily lain await with many knights with him, and taken all the knights in this country to see and espy their adventures, he hath taken them by force and brought them to his prison. And so he took us separately as we rode on our adventures, and many good knights have died in this prison for hunger, to the number of eighteen knights; and if any of us all that here is, or hath been, would have foughten with his brother Ontzlake, he would have delivered us, but for because this Damas is so false and so full of treason we would never fight for him to die for it.

And he thanked her, and weened it had been so, but she was false, for the sword and the scabbard was counterfeit, and brittle, and false.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000533\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000533\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000534\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000534\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000535\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000535\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>\\nOf the battle between King Arthur and Accolon.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000536\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000536\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000537\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000537\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then they dressed them on both parties of the field, and let their horses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of the shield with their spear-heads, that both horse and man went to the earth; and then they started up both, and pulled out their swords.

Mercy shall ye have, said Arthur: here may ye see what adventures befall ofttime of errant knights, how that I have fought with a knight of mine own unto my great damage and his both. But, sirs, because I am sore hurt, and he both, and I had great need of a little rest, ye shall understand the opinion betwixt you two brethren: As to thee, Sir Damas, for whom I have been champion and won the field of this knight, yet will I judge because ye, Sir Damas, are called an orgulous knight, and full of villainy, and not worth of prowess your deeds, therefore I will that ye give unto your brother all the whole manor with the appurtenance, under this form, that Sir Ontzlake hold the manor of you, and yearly to give you a palfrey to ride upon, for that will become you better to ride on than upon a courser. Also I charge thee, Sir Damas, upon pain of death, that thou never distress no knights errant that ride on their adventure. And also that thou restore these twenty knights that thou hast long kept prisoners, of all their harness, that they be content for; and if any of them come to my court and complain of thee, by my head thou shalt die therefore. Also, Sir Ontzlake, as to you, because ye are named a good knight, and full of prowess, and true and gentle in all your deeds, this shall be your charge I will give you, that in all goodly haste ye come unto me and my court, and ye shall be a knight of mine, and if your deeds be thereafter I shall so prefer you, by the grace of God, that ye shall in short time be in ease for to live as worshipfully as your brother Sir Damas. God thank your largeness of your goodness and of your bounty, I shall be from henceforward at all times at your commandment; for, sir, said Sir Ontzlake, as God would, as I was hurt but late with an adventurous knight through both my thighs, that grieved me sore, and else had I done this battle with you. God would, said Arthur, it had been so, for then had not I been hurt as I am. I shall tell you the cause why: for I had not been hurt as I am, had it not been mine own sword, that was stolen from me by treason; and this battle was ordained aforehand to have slain me, and so it was brought to the purpose by false treason, and by false enchantment. Alas, said Sir Ontzlake, that is great pity that ever so noble a man as ye are of your deeds and prowess, that any man or woman might find in their hearts to work any treason against you. I shall reward them, said Arthur, in short time, by the grace of God. Now, tell me, said Arthur, how far am I from Camelot? Sir, ye are two days’ journey therefrom. I would fain be at some place of worship, said Sir Arthur, that I might rest me. Sir, said Sir Ontzlake, hereby is a rich abbey of your elders’ foundation, of nuns, but three miles hence. So the king took his leave of all the people, and mounted upon horseback, and Sir Accolon with him. And when they were come to the abbey, he let fetch leeches and search his wounds and Accolon’s both; but Sir Accolon died within four days, for he had bled so much blood that he might not live, but King Arthur was well recovered. So when Accolon was dead he let send him on an horse-bier with six knights unto Camelot, and said: Bear him to my sister Morgan le Fay, and say that I send her him to a present, and tell her I have my sword Excalibur and the scabbard; so they departed with the body.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000559\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000559\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000560\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000560\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000561\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000561\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>\\nHow Morgan would have slain Sir Uriens her husband, and how Sir Uwaine her son saved him.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000562\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000562\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000563\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000563\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>The meanwhile Morgan le Fay had weened King Arthur had been dead.

Then they spurred their horses, and followed fast, and within a while Arthur had a sight of Morgan le Fay; then he chased as fast as he might. When she espied him following her, she rode a greater pace through the forest till she came to a plain, and when she saw she might not escape, she rode unto a lake thereby, and said, Whatsoever come of me, my brother shall not have this scabbard.

I believe you, said Morgan. Anon after as she rode she met a knight leading another knight on his horse before him, bound hand and foot, blindfold, to have drowned him in a fountain. When she saw this knight so bound, she asked him, What will ye do with that knight? Lady, said he, I will drown him. For what cause? she asked. For I found him with my wife, and she shall have the same death anon. That were pity, said Morgan le Fay. Now, what say ye, knight, is it truth that he saith of you? she said to the knight that should be drowned. Nay truly, madam, he saith not right on me. Of whence be ye, said Morgan le Fay, and of what country? I am of the court of King Arthur, and my name is Manassen, cousin unto Accolon of Gaul. Ye say well, said she, and for the love of him ye shall be delivered, and ye shall have your adversary in the same case ye be in. So Manassen was loosed and the other knight bound. And anon Manassen unarmed him, and armed himself in his harness, and so mounted on horseback, and the knight afore him, and so threw him into the fountain and drowned him. And then he rode unto Morgan again, and asked if she would anything unto King Arthur. Tell him that I rescued thee, not for the love of him but for the love of Accolon, and tell him I fear him not while I can make me and them that be with me in likeness of stones; and let him wit I can do much more when I see my time.

Say on, said the king, what ye will. Sir, said the damosel, put not on you this mantle till ye have seen more, and in no wise let it not come on you, nor on no knight of yours, till ye command the bringer thereof to put it upon her. Well, said King Arthur, it shall be done as ye counsel me. And then he said unto the damosel that came from his sister, Damosel, this mantle that ye have brought me, I will see it upon you. Sir, she said, It will not beseem me to wear a king’s garment. By my head, said Arthur, ye shall wear it or it come on my back, or any man’s that here is. And so the king made it to be put upon her, and forth withal she fell down dead, and never more spake word after and burnt to coals. Then was the king wonderly wroth, more than he was to-forehand, and said unto King Uriens, My sister, your wife, is alway about to betray me, and well I wot either ye, or my nephew, your son, is of counsel with her to have me destroyed; but as for you, said the king to King Uriens, I deem not greatly that ye be of her counsel, for Accolon confessed to me by his own mouth, that she would have destroyed you as well as me, therefore I hold you excused; but as for your son, Sir Uwaine, I hold him suspect, therefore I charge you put him out of my court. So Sir Uwaine was discharged. And when Sir Gawaine wist that, he made him ready to go with him; and said, Whoso banisheth my cousin-germain shall banish me. So they two departed, and rode into a great forest, and so they came to an abbey of monks, and there were well lodged. But when the king wist that Sir Gawaine was departed from the court, there was made great sorrow among all the estates. Now, said Gaheris, Gawaine’s brother, we have lost two good knights for the love of one. So on the morn they heard their masses in the abbey, and so they rode forth till that they came to a great forest. Then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret [of] twelve fair damosels, and two knights armed on great horses, and the damosels went to and fro by a tree. And then was Sir Gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree, and ever as the damosels came by it they spit upon it, and some threw mire upon the shield.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000585\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000585\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000586\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000586\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000587\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000587\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>\\nHow Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine met with twelve fair damosels, and how they complained on Sir Marhaus.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000588\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000588\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000589\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000589\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked why they did that despite to the shield. Sir, said the damosels, we shall tell you. There is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield, and he is a passing good man of his hands, but he hateth all ladies and gentlewomen, and therefore we do all this despite to the shield. I shall say you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure though he hate you he hath some certain cause, and peradventure he loveth in some other places ladies and gentlewomen, and to be loved again, an he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of. Now, what is his name? Sir, said they, his name is Marhaus, the king’s son of Ireland. I know him well, said Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good knight as any is alive, for I saw him once proved at a jousts where many knights were gathered, and that time there might no man withstand him. Ah! said Sir Gawaine, damosels, methinketh ye are to blame, for it is to suppose, he that hung that shield there, he will not be long therefrom, and then may those knights match him on horseback, and that is more your worship than thus; for I will abide no longer to see a knight’s shield dishonoured. And therewith Sir Uwaine and Gawaine departed a little from them, and then were they ware where Sir Marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward them. And when the twelve damosels saw Sir Marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild, so that some of them fell by the way. Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield, and said on high, Sir Marhaus, defend thee. And so they ran together that the knight brake his spear on Marhaus, and Marhaus smote him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse’s back. That saw the other knight of the turret, and dressed him toward Marhaus, and they met so eagerly together that the knight of the turret was soon smitten down, horse and man, stark dead.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000590\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000590\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000591\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000591\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000592\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000592\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>\\nHow Sir Marhaus jousted with Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine, and overthrew them both.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000593\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000593\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000594\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000594\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then Sir Marhaus rode unto his shield, and saw how it was defouled, and said, Of this despite I am a part avenged, but for her love that gave me this white shield I shall wear thee, and hang mine where thou wast; and so he hanged it about his neck.

So these two knights came together with great raundon, that Sir Uwaine smote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in pieces on the shield, and Sir Marhaus smote him so sore that horse and man he bare to the earth, and hurt Sir Uwaine on the left side.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000595\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000595\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000596\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000596\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then Sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward Gawaine with his spear, and when Sir Gawaine saw that he dressed his shield, and they aventred their spears, and they came together with all the might of their horses, that either knight smote other so hard in midst of their shields, but Sir Gawaine’s spear brake, but Sir Marhaus’ spear held; and therewith Sir Gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth. And lightly Sir Gawaine rose on his feet, and pulled out his sword, and dressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and Sir Marhaus saw that, and pulled out his sword and began to come to Sir Gawaine on horseback. Sir knight, said Sir Gawaine, alight on foot, or else I will slay thy horse. Gramercy, said Sir Marhaus, of your gentleness ye teach me courtesy, for it is not for one knight to be on foot, and the other on horseback. And therewith Sir Marhaus set his spear against a tree and alighted and tied his horse to a tree, and dressed his shield, and either came unto other eagerly, and smote together with their swords that their shields flew in cantels, and they bruised their helms and their hauberks, and wounded either other. But Sir Gawaine from it passed nine of the clock waxed ever stronger and stronger, for then it came to the hour of noon, and thrice his might was increased. All this espied Sir Marhaus and had great wonder how his might increased, and so they wounded other passing sore. And then when it was past noon, and when it drew toward evensong, Sir Gawaine’s strength feebled, and waxed passing faint that unnethes he might dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger. Sir knight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well felt that ye are a passing good knight and a marvellous man of might as ever I felt any, while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and therefore it were pity to do you hurt, for I feel ye are passing feeble. Ah, said Sir Gawaine, gentle knight, ye say the word that I should say. And therewith they took off their helms, and either kissed other, and there they swore together either to love other as brethren. And Sir Marhaus prayed Sir Gawaine to lodge with him that night. And so they took their horses, and rode toward Sir Marhaus’ house. And as they rode by the way, Sir knight, said Sir Gawaine, I have marvel that so valiant a man as ye be love no ladies nor damosels. Sir, said Sir Marhaus, they name me wrongfully those that give me that name, but well I wot it be the damosels of the turret that so name me, and other such as they be. Now shall I tell you for what cause I hate them: for they be sorceresses and enchanters many of them, and be a knight never so good of his body and full of prowess as man may be, they will make him a stark coward to have the better of him, and this is the principal cause that I hate them; and to all good ladies and gentlewomen I owe my service as a knight ought to do.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000597\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000597\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000598\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000598\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>As the book rehearseth in French, there were many knights that overmatched Sir Gawaine, for all the thrice might that he had: Sir Launcelot de Lake, Sir Tristram, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Percivale, Sir Pelleas, and Sir Marhaus, these six knights had the better of Sir Gawaine. Then within a little while they came to Sir Marhaus’ place, which was in a little priory, and there they alighted, and ladies and damosels unarmed them, and hastily looked to their hurts, for they were all three hurt. And so they had all three good lodging with Sir Marhaus, and good cheer; for when he wist that they were King Arthur’s sister’s sons he made them all the cheer that lay in his power, and so they sojourned there a sennight, and were well eased of their wounds, and at the last departed. Now, said Sir Marhaus, we will not depart so lightly, for I will bring you through the forest; and rode day by day well a seven days or they found any adventure. At the last they came into a great forest, that was named the country and forest of Arroy, and the country of strange adventures. In this country, said Sir Marhaus, came never knight since it was christened but he found strange adventures; and so they rode, and came into a deep valley full of stones, and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was the head of the stream a fair fountain, and three damosels sitting thereby. And then they rode to them, and either saluted other, and the eldest had a garland of gold about her head, and she was three score winter of age or more, and her hair was white under the garland. The second damosel was of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of gold about her head. The third damosel was but fifteen year of age, and a garland of flowers about her head. When these knights had so beheld them, they asked them the cause why they sat at that fountain? We be here, said the damosels, for this cause: if we may see any errant knights, to teach them unto strange adventures; and ye be three knights that seek adventures, and we be three damosels, and therefore each one of you must choose one of us; and when ye have done so we will lead you unto three highways, and there each of you shall choose a way and his damosel with him. And this day twelvemonth ye must meet here again, and God send you your lives, and thereto ye must plight your troth.

I shall show you some to-morn, said the old knight, and that marvellous. So, on the morn they rode into the forest of adventures to a laund, and thereby they found a cross, and as they stood and hoved there came by them the fairest knight and the seemliest man that ever they saw, making the greatest dole that ever man made.

And this knight Sir Pelleas was the best knight that was there, and there were five hundred knights, but there was never man that ever Sir Pelleas met withal but he struck him down, or else from his horse; and every day of three days he struck down twenty knights, therefore they gave him the prize, and forthwithal he went thereas the Lady Ettard was, and gave her the circlet, and said openly she was the fairest lady that there was, and that would he prove upon any knight that would say nay.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000615\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000615\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000616\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000616\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000617\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000617\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br>\\nHow King Pelleas suffered himself to be taken prisoner because he would have a sight of his lady, and how Sir Gawaine promised him to get to him the love of his lady.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000618\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000618\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000619\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000619\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And so he chose her for his sovereign lady, and never to love other but her, but she was so proud that she had scorn of him, and said that she would never love him though he would die for her. Wherefore all ladies and gentlewomen had scorn of her that she was so proud, for there were fairer than she, and there was none that was there but an Sir Pelleas would have proffered them love, they would have loved him for his noble prowess. And so this knight promised the Lady Ettard to follow her into this country, and never to leave her till she loved him. And thus he is here the most part nigh her, and lodged by a priory, and every week she sendeth knights to fight with him. And when he hath put them to the worse, then will he suffer them wilfully to take him prisoner, because he would have a sight of this lady. And always she doth him great despite, for sometime she maketh her knights to tie him to his horse’s tail, and some to bind him under the horse’s belly; thus in the most shamefullest ways that she can think he is brought to her. And all she doth it for to cause him to leave this country, and to leave his loving; but all this cannot make him to leave, for an he would have fought on foot he might have had the better of the ten knights as well on foot as on horseback. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, it is great pity of him; and after this night I will seek him to-morrow, in this forest, to do him all the help I can. So on the morn Sir Gawaine took his leave of his host Sir Carados, and rode into the forest; and at the last he met with Sir Pelleas, making great moan out of measure, so each of them saluted other, and asked him why he made such sorrow. And as it is above rehearsed, Sir Pelleas told Sir Gawaine: But always I suffer her knights to fare so with me as ye saw yesterday, in trust at the last to win her love, for she knoweth well all her knights should not lightly win me, an me list to fight with them to the uttermost. Wherefore an I loved her not so sore, I had liefer die an hundred times, an I might die so oft, rather than I would suffer that despite; but I trust she will have pity upon me at the last, for love causeth many a good knight to suffer to have his entent, but alas I am unfortunate.

Is there no remedy but that I must have ado with you and your six sons at once? said Sir Marhaus. No, said the duke, for this cause I made mine avow, for Sir Gawaine slew my seven sons in a recounter, therefore I made mine avow, there should never knight of King Arthur’s court lodge with me, or come thereas I might have ado with him, but that I would have a revenging of my sons’ death. What is your name? said Sir Marhaus; I require you tell me, an it please you. Wit thou well I am the Duke of South Marches. Ah, said Sir Marhaus, I have heard say that ye have been long time a great foe unto my lord Arthur and to his knights. That shall ye feel to-morn, said the duke.

And on the morn he arose early and heard mass, and brake his fast, and so he rode unto the plain without the gates, where hoved the two brethren abiding him. So they rode together passing sore, that Sir Edward and Sir Hue brake their spears upon Sir Uwaine. And Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward that he fell over his horse and yet his spear brast not. And then he spurred his horse and came upon Sir Hue and overthrew him, but they soon recovered and dressed their shields and drew their swords and bade Sir Uwaine alight and do his battle to the uttermost. Then Sir Uwaine devoided his horse suddenly, and put his shield afore him and drew his sword, and so they dressed together, and either gave other such strokes, and there these two brethren wounded Sir Uwaine passing grievously that the Lady of the Rock weened he should have died. And thus they fought together five hours as men raged out of reason. And at the last Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward upon the helm such a stroke that his sword carved unto his canel bone, and then Sir Hue abated his courage, but Sir Uwaine pressed fast to have slain him. That saw Sir Hue: he kneeled down and yielded him to Sir Uwaine. And he of his gentleness received his sword, and took him by the hand, and went into the castle together. Then the Lady of the Rock was passing glad, and the other brother made great sorrow for his brother’s death. Then the lady was restored of all her lands, and Sir Hue was commanded to be at the court of King Arthur at the next feast of Pentecost. So Sir Uwaine dwelt with the lady nigh half a year, for it was long or he might be whole of his great hurts. And so when it drew nigh the term-day that Sir Gawaine, Sir Marhaus, and Sir Uwaine should meet at the cross-way, then every knight drew him thither to hold his promise that they had made; and Sir Marhaus and Sir Uwaine brought their damosels with them, but Sir Gawaine had lost his damosel, as it is afore rehearsed.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000668\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000668\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000669\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000669\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000670\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000670\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>\\nHow at the year’s end all three knights with their three damosels met at the fountain.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000671\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000671\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000672\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000672\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Right so at the twelvemonths’ end they met all three knights at the fountain and their damosels, but the damosel that Sir Gawaine had could say but little worship of him so they departed from the damosels and rode through a great forest, and there they met with a messenger that came from King Arthur, that had sought them well-nigh a twelvemonth throughout all England, Wales, and Scotland, and charged if ever he might find Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine to bring them to the court again.

kings, princes, and noble knights all of the Round Table, there came into his hall, he sitting in his throne royal, twelve ancient men, bearing each of them a branch of olive, in token that they came as ambassadors and messengers from the Emperor Lucius, which was called at that time, Dictator or Procuror of the Public Weal of Rome. Which said messengers, after their entering and coming into the presence of King Arthur, did to him their obeisance in making to him reverence, and said to him in this wise: The high and mighty Emperor Lucius sendeth to the King of Britain greeting, commanding thee to acknowledge him for thy lord, and to send him the truage due of this realm unto the Empire, which thy father and other to-fore thy precessors have paid as is of record, and thou as rebel not knowing him as thy sovereign, withholdest and retainest contrary to the statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy Julius Cesar, conqueror of this realm, and first Emperor of Rome. And if thou refuse his demand and commandment know thou for certain that he shall make strong war against thee, thy realms and lands, and shall chastise thee and thy subjects, that it shall be ensample perpetual unto all kings and princes, for to deny their truage unto that noble empire which domineth upon the universal world. Then when they had showed the effect of their message, the king commanded them to withdraw them, and said he should take advice of council and give to them an answer. Then some of the young knights, hearing this their message, would have run on them to have slain them, saying that it was a rebuke to all the knights there being present to suffer them to say so to the king. And anon the king commanded that none of them, upon pain of death, to missay them nor do them any harm, and commanded a knight to bring them to their lodging, and see that they have all that is necessary and requisite for them, with the best cheer, and that no dainty be spared, for the Romans be great lords, and though their message please me not nor my court, yet I must remember mine honour.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000685\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000685\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000686\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000686\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>After this the king let call all his lords and knights of the Round Table to counsel upon this matter, and desired them to say their advice.

O Sir, said one of the senators, let be such vain words, for we let you wit that I and my fellows were full sore afeard to behold his countenance; I fear me ye have made a rod for yourself, for he intendeth to be lord of this empire, which sore is to be doubted if he come, for he is all another man than ye ween, and holdeth the most noble court of the world, all other kings nor princes may not compare unto his noble maintenance. On New Year’s Day we saw him in his estate, which was the royalest that ever we saw, for he was served at his table with nine kings, and the noblest fellowship of other princes, lords, and knights that be in the world, and every knight approved and like a lord, and holdeth Table Round: and in his person the most manly man that liveth, and is like to conquer all the world, for unto his courage it is too little: wherefore I advise you to keep well your marches and straits in the mountains; for certainly he is a lord to be doubted. Well, said Lucius, before Easter I suppose to pass the mountains, and so forth into France, and there bereave him his lands with Genoese and other mighty warriors of Tuscany and Lombardy. And I shall send for them all that be subjects and allied to the empire of Rome to come to mine aid. And forthwith sent old wise knights unto these countries following: first to Ambage and Arrage, to Alexandria, to India, to Armenia, whereas the river of Euphrates runneth into Asia, to Africa, and Europe the Large, to Ertayne and Elamye, to Araby, Egypt, and to Damascus, to Damietta and Cayer, to Cappadocia, to Tarsus, Turkey, Pontus and Pamphylia, to Syria and Galatia. And all these were subject to Rome and many more, as Greece, Cyprus, Macedonia, Calabria, Cateland, Portugal, with many thousands of Spaniards. Thus all these kings, dukes, and admirals, assembled about Rome, with sixteen kings at once, with great multitude of people.

And after departed and entered into the sea at Sandwich with all his army, with a great multitude of ships, galleys, cogs, and dromounds, sailing on the sea.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000703\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000703\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000704\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000704\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000705\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000705\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>\\nHow King Arthur being shipped and lying in his cabin had a marvellous dream and of the exposition thereof.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000706\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000706\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000707\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000707\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And as the king lay in his cabin in the ship, he fell in a slumbering and dreamed a marvellous dream: him seemed that a dreadful dragon did drown much of his people, and he came flying out of the west, and his head was enamelled with azure, and his shoulders shone as gold, his belly like mails of a marvellous hue, his tail full of tatters, his feet full of fine sable, and his claws like fine gold; and an hideous flame of fire flew out of his mouth, like as the land and water had flamed all of fire.

That may I do, said the knight, if I will, and so will I if thou wilt succour and aid me, that I may be christened and believe on God, and thereof I require thee of thy manhood, and it shall be great merit for thy soul. I grant, said Gawaine, so God help me, to accomplish all thy desire, but first tell me what thou soughtest here thus alone, and of what land and liegiance thou art of. Sir, he said, my name is Priamus, and a great prince is my father, and he hath been rebel unto Rome and overridden many of their lands. My father is lineally descended of Alexander and of Hector by right line. And Duke Joshua and Maccabaeus were of our lineage. I am right inheritor of Alexandria and Africa, and all the out isles, yet will I believe on thy Lord that thou believest on; and for thy labour I shall give thee treasure enough. I was so elate and hauteyn in my heart that I thought no man my peer, nor to me semblable. I was sent into this war with seven score knights, and now I have encountered with thee, which hast given to me of fighting my fill, wherefore sir knight, I pray thee to tell me what thou art. I am no knight, said Gawaine, I have been brought up in the guardrobe with the noble King Arthur many years, for to take heed to his armour and his other array, and to point his paltocks that long to himself. At Yule last he made me yeoman, and gave to me horse and harness, and an hundred pound in money; and if fortune be my friend, I doubt not but to be well advanced and holpen by my liege lord. Ah, said Priamus, if his knaves be so keen and fierce, his knights be passing good: now for the King’s love of Heaven, whether thou be a knave or a knight, tell thou me thy name. By God, said Sir Gawaine, now I will say thee sooth, my name is Sir Gawaine, and known I am in his court and in his chamber, and one of the knights of the Round Table, he dubbed me a duke with his own hand. Therefore grudge not if this grace is to me fortuned, it is the goodness of God that lent to me my strength.

But soon after on a Saturday came unto King Arthur all the senators that were left alive, and the noblest cardinals that then dwelt in Rome, and prayed him of peace, and proferred him full large, and besought him as governor to give licence for six weeks for to assemble all the Romans, and then to crown him emperor with chrism as it belongeth to so high estate. I assent, said the king, like as ye have devised, and at Christmas there to be crowned, and to hold my Round Table with my knights as me liketh. And then the senators made ready for his enthronization. And at the day appointed, as the romance telleth, he came into Rome, and was crowned emperor by the pope’s hand, with all the royalty that could be made, and sojourned there a time, and established all his lands from Rome into France, and gave lands and realms unto his servants and knights, to everych after his desert, in such wise that none complained, rich nor poor. And he gave to Sir Priamus the duchy of Lorraine; and he thanked him, and said he would serve him the days of his life; and after made dukes and earls, and made every man rich.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000792\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000792\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000793\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000793\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then after this all his knights and lords assembled them afore him, and said: Blessed be God, your war is finished and your conquest achieved, in so much that we know none so great nor mighty that dare make war against you: wherefore we beseech you to return homeward, and give us licence to go home to our wives, from whom we have been long, and to rest us, for your journey is finished with honour and worship.

Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there came afore him three score ladies and damosels, and all kneeled unto him, and thanked God and him of their deliverance; For sir, said they, the most party of us have been here this seven year their prisoners, and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all great gentlewomen born; and blessed be the time, knight, that ever thou be born, for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in this world, that will we bear record, and we all pray you to tell us your name, that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison. Fair damosel, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, sir, said they all, well mayest thou be he, for else save yourself, as we deemed, there might never knight have the better of these two giants; for many fair knights have assayed it, and here have ended, and many times have we wished after you, and these two giants dread never knight but you. Now may ye say, said Sir Launcelot, unto your friends how and who hath delivered you, and greet them all from me, and if that I come in any of your marches, show me such cheer as ye have cause, and what treasure that there in this castle is I give it you for a reward for your grievance, and the lord that is owner of this castle I would he received it as is right. Fair sir, said they, the name of this castle is Tintagil, and a duke ought it sometime that had wedded fair Igraine, and after wedded her Uther Pendragon, and gat on her Arthur.

And afore him he saw a long bridge, and three pavilions stood thereon, of silk and sendal of divers hue. And without the pavilions hung three white shields on truncheons of spears, and great long spears stood upright by the pavilions, and at every pavilion’s door stood three fresh squires, and so Sir Launcelot passed by them and spake no word. When he was passed the three knights said them that it was the proud Kay; He weeneth no knight so good as he, and the contrary is ofttime proved. By my faith, said one of the knights, his name was Sir Gaunter, I will ride after him and assay him for all his pride, and ye may behold how that I speed. So this knight, Sir Gaunter, armed him, and hung his shield upon his shoulder, and mounted upon a great horse, and gat his spear in his hand, and walloped after Sir Launcelot. And when he came nigh him, he cried, Abide, thou proud knight Sir Kay, for thou shalt not pass quit. So Sir Launcelot turned him, and either feutred their spears, and came together with all their mights, and Sir Gaunter’s spear brake, but Sir Launcelot smote him down horse and man. And when Sir Gaunter was at the earth his brethren said each one to other, Yonder knight is not Sir Kay, for he is bigger than he. I dare lay my head, said Sir Gilmere, yonder knight hath slain Sir Kay and hath taken his horse and his harness. Whether it be so or no, said Sir Raynold, the third brother, let us now go mount upon our horses and rescue our brother Sir Gaunter, upon pain of death. We all shall have work enough to match that knight, for ever meseemeth by his person it is Sir Launcelot, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Pelleas, the good knight.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000905\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000905\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000906\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000906\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then anon they took their horses and overtook Sir Launcelot, and Sir Gilmere put forth his spear, and ran to Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot smote him down that he lay in a swoon.

And then was he ware of an old manor, and thither ran the brachet, and so over the bridge. So Sir Launcelot rode over that bridge that was old and feeble; and when he came in midst of a great hall, there he saw lie a dead knight that was a seemly man, and that brachet licked his wounds. And therewithal came out a lady weeping and wringing her hands; and then she said, O knight, too much sorrow hast thou brought me. Why say ye so? said Sir Launcelot, I did never this knight no harm, for hither by feute of blood this brachet brought me; and therefore, fair lady, be not displeased with me, for I am full sore aggrieved of your grievance. Truly, sir, she said, I trow it be not ye that hath slain my husband, for he that did that deed is sore wounded, and he is never likely to recover, that shall I ensure him. What was your husband’s name? said Sir Launcelot. Sir, said she, his name was called Sir Gilbert the Bastard, one of the best knights of the world, and he that hath slain him I know not his name. Now God send you better comfort, said Sir Launcelot; and so he departed and went into the forest again, and there he met with a damosel, the which knew him well, and she said aloud, Well be ye found, my lord; and now I require thee, on thy knighthood, help my brother that is sore wounded, and never stinteth bleeding; for this day he fought with Sir Gilbert the Bastard and slew him in plain battle, and there was my brother sore wounded, and there is a lady a sorceress that dwelleth in a castle here beside, and this day she told me my brother’s wounds should never be whole till I could find a knight that would go into the Chapel Perilous, and there he should find a sword and a bloody cloth that the wounded knight was lapped in, and a piece of that cloth and sword should heal my brother’s wounds, so that his wounds were searched with the sword and the cloth. This is a marvellous thing, said Sir Launcelot, but what is your brother’s name? Sir, she said, his name was Sir Meliot de Logres. That me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, for he is a fellow of the Table Round, and to his help I will do my power. Then, sir, said she, follow even this highway, and it will bring you unto the Chapel Perilous; and here I shall abide till God send you here again, and, but you speed, I know no knight living that may achieve that adventure.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000923\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000923\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000924\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000924\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000925\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000925\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>\\nHow Sir Launcelot came into the Chapel Perilous and gat there of a dead corpse a piece of the cloth and a sword.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000926\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000926\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000927\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000927\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Right so Sir Launcelot departed, and when he came unto the Chapel Perilous he alighted down, and tied his horse unto a little gate.

With that he saw by him there stand a thirty great knights, more by a yard than any man that ever he had seen, and all those grinned and gnashed at Sir Launcelot. And when he saw their countenance he dreaded him sore, and so put his shield afore him, and took his sword ready in his hand ready unto battle, and they were all armed in black harness ready with their shields and their swords drawn.

Whether that I live or die, said Sir Launcelot, with no great word get ye it again, therefore fight for it an ye list. Then right so he passed throughout them, and beyond the chapel yard there met him a fair damosel, and said, Sir Launcelot, leave that sword behind thee, or thou wilt die for it. I leave it not, said Sir Launcelot, for no treaties. No, said she, an thou didst leave that sword, Queen Guenever should thou never see. Then were I a fool an I would leave this sword, said Launcelot. Now, gentle knight, said the damosel, I require thee to kiss me but once. Nay, said Sir Launcelot, that God me forbid. Well, sir, said she, an thou hadst kissed me thy life days had been done, but now, alas, she said, I have lost all my labour, for I ordained this chapel for thy sake, and for Sir Gawaine. And once I had Sir Gawaine within me, and at that time he fought with that knight that lieth there dead in yonder chapel, Sir Gilbert the Bastard; and at that time he smote the left hand off of Sir Gilbert the Bastard. And, Sir Launcelot, now I tell thee, I have loved thee this seven year, but there may no woman have thy love but Queen Guenever. But sithen I may not rejoice thee to have thy body alive, I had kept no more joy in this world but to have thy body dead. Then would I have balmed it and served it, and so have kept it my life days, and daily I should have clipped thee, and kissed thee, in despite of Queen Guenever. Ye say well, said Sir Launcelot, Jesu preserve me from your subtle crafts. And therewithal he took his horse and so departed from her. And as the book saith, when Sir Launcelot was departed she took such sorrow that she died within a fourteen night, and her name was Hellawes the sorceress, Lady of the Castle Nigramous.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000930\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000930\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000931\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000931\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Anon Sir Launcelot met with the damosel, Sir Meliot’s sister.

Nay, nay, said Sir Phelot, for I know thee better than thou weenest, therefore thou gettest no weapon, an I may keep you therefrom. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, that ever a knight should die weaponless. And therewith he waited above him and under him, and over his head he saw a rownsepyk, a big bough leafless, and therewith he brake it off by the body. And then he came lower and awaited how his own horse stood, and suddenly he leapt on the further side of the horse, fro-ward the knight.

And as he rode in a valley he saw a knight chasing a lady, with a naked sword, to have slain her. And by fortune as this knight should have slain this lady, she cried on Sir Launcelot and prayed him to rescue her. When Sir Launcelot saw that mischief, he took his horse and rode between them, saying, Knight, fie for shame, why wilt thou slay this lady? thou dost shame unto thee and all knights. What hast thou to do betwixt me and my wife? said the knight. I will slay her maugre thy head. That shall ye not, said Sir Launcelot, for rather we two will have ado together. Sir Launcelot, said the knight, thou dost not thy part, for this lady hath betrayed me. It is not so, said the lady, truly he saith wrong on me. And for because I love and cherish my cousin germain, he is jealous betwixt him and me; and as I shall answer to God there was never sin betwixt us. But, sir, said the lady, as thou art called the worshipfullest knight of the world, I require thee of true knighthood, keep me and save me. For whatsomever ye say he will slay me, for he is without mercy. Have ye no doubt, said Launcelot, it shall not lie in his power. Sir, said the knight, in your sight I will be ruled as ye will have me. And so Sir Launcelot rode on the one side and she on the other: he had not ridden but a while, but the knight bade Sir Launcelot turn him and look behind him, and said, Sir, yonder come men of arms after us riding. And so Sir Launcelot turned him and thought no treason, and therewith was the knight and the lady on one side, and suddenly he swapped off his lady’s head.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000946\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000946\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000947\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000947\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And when Sir Launcelot had espied him what he had done, he said, and called him, Traitor, thou hast shamed me for ever.

Well then will I have ado with him to the utterance, and so he purveyed him and rode against him. And Beaumains saw him and made him ready, and there they met with all that ever their horses might run, and brast their spears either in three pieces, and their horses rushed so together that both their horses fell dead to the earth; and lightly they avoided their horses and put their shields afore them, and drew their swords, and gave many great strokes that sometime they hurtled together that they fell grovelling on the ground. Thus they fought two hours and more, that their shields and their hauberks were all forhewen, and in many steads they were wounded. So at the last Sir Beaumains smote him through the cost of the body, and then he retrayed him here and there, and knightly maintained his battle long time.

For certainly now I wot well it was ye that slew my brother the Black Knight at the black thorn; he was a full noble knight, his name was Sir Percard. Also I am sure that ye are he that won mine other brother the Green Knight, his name was Sir Pertolepe. Also ye won my brother the Red Knight, Sir Perimones. And now since ye have won these, this shall I do for to please you: ye shall have homage and fealty of me, and an hundred knights to be always at your commandment, to go and ride where ye will command us. And so they went unto Sir Persant’s pavilion and drank the wine, and ate spices, and afterward Sir Persant made him to rest upon a bed until supper time, and after supper to bed again. When Beaumains was abed, Sir Persant had a lady, a fair daughter of eighteen year of age, and there he called her unto him, and charged her and commanded her upon his blessing to go unto the knight’s bed, and lie down by his side, and make him no strange cheer, but good cheer, and take him in thine arms and kiss him, and look that this be done, I charge you, as ye will have my love and my good will. So Sir Persant’s daughter did as her father bade her, and so she went unto Sir Beaumains’ bed, and privily she dispoiled her, and laid her down by him, and then he awoke and saw her, and asked her what she was. Sir, she said, I am Sir Persant’s daughter, that by the commandment of my father am come hither. Be ye a maid or a wife? said he. Sir, she said, I am a clean maiden. God defend, said he, that I should defoil you to do Sir Persant such a shame; therefore, fair damosel, arise out of this bed or else I will. Sir, she said, I came not to you by mine own will, but as I was commanded. Alas, said Sir Beaumains, I were a shameful knight an I would do your father any disworship; and so he kissed her, and so she departed and came unto Sir Persant her father, and told him all how she had sped. Truly, said Sir Persant, whatsomever he be, he is come of a noble blood.

And but if thou tell me, said Dame Lionesse, thou shalt never escape this castle, but ever here to be prisoner. As for that, said the dwarf, I fear not greatly to tell his name and of what kin he is come.

And then there came the harbingers from King Arthur for to harbour him, and his kings, dukes, earls, barons, and knights. And then Sir Gareth prayed Dame Lionesse and the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother, and Sir Gringamore, that in no wise there should none of them tell not his name, and make no more of him than of the least knight that there was, For, he said, I will not be known of neither more nor less, neither at the beginning neither at the ending. Then Dame Lionesse said unto Sir Gareth: Sir, I will lend you a ring, but I would pray you as you love me heartily let me have it again when the tournament is done, for that ring increaseth my beauty much more than it is of himself. And the virtue of my ring is that, that is green it will turn to red, and that is red it will turn in likeness to green, and that is blue it will turn to likeness of white, and that is white it will turn in likeness to blue, and so it will do of all manner of colours. Also who that beareth my ring shall lose no blood, and for great love I will give you this ring. Gramercy, said Sir Gareth, mine own lady, for this ring is passing meet for me, for it will turn all manner of likeness that I am in, and that shall cause me that I shall not be known. Then Sir Gringamore gave Sir Gareth a bay courser that was a passing good horse; also he gave him good armour and sure, and a noble sword that sometime Sir Gringamore’s father won upon an heathen tyrant. And so thus every knight made him ready to that tournament. And King Arthur was come two days to-fore the Assumption of our Lady. And there was all manner of royalty of all minstrelsy that might be found. Also there came Queen Guenever and the Queen of Orkney, Sir Gareth’s mother.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001227\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001227\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001228\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001228\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And upon the Assumption Day, when mass and matins were done, there were heralds with trumpets commanded to blow to the field.

And by fortune he met with his brother Sir Gawaine, and there he put Sir Gawaine to the worse, for he put off his helm, and so he served five or six knights of the Round Table, that all men said he put him in the most pain, and best he did his devoir. For when Sir Tristram beheld him how he first jousted and after fought so well with a sword, then he rode unto Sir Ironside and to Sir Persant of Inde, and asked them, by their faith, What manner a knight is yonder knight that seemeth in so many divers colours? Truly, meseemeth, said Tristram, that he putteth himself in great pain, for he never ceaseth. Wot ye not what he is? said Sir Ironside. No, said Sir Tristram. Then shall ye know that this is he that loveth the lady of the castle, and she him again; and this is he that won me when I besieged the lady of this castle, and this is he that won Sir Persant of Inde, and his three brethren. What is his name, said Sir Tristram, and of what blood is he come? He was called in the court of King Arthur, Beaumains, but his right name is Sir Gareth of Orkney, brother to Sir Gawaine.

And suddenly Sir Marhaus rose grovelling, and threw his sword and his shield from him, and so ran to his ships and fled his way, and Sir Tristram had ever his shield and his sword.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001397\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001397\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001398\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001398\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And when Sir Tristram saw Sir Marhaus withdraw him, he said: Ah!

So Sir Tristram departed and took the sea with all his fellowship.

Come on, fellow, said the king, with me anon and show me unto Sir Tristram. So the king took a little hackney and but few fellowship with him, until he came unto Sir Tristram’s pavilion. And when Sir Tristram saw the king he ran unto him and would have holden his stirrup. But the king leapt from his horse lightly, and either halsed other in their arms. My gracious lord, said Sir Tristram, gramercy of your great goodnesses showed unto me in your marches and lands: and at that time I promised you to do you service an ever it lay in my power. And, gentle knight, said the king unto Sir Tristram, now have I great need of you, never had I so great need of no knight’s help. How so, my good lord? said Sir Tristram. I shall tell you, said the king: I am summoned and appealed from my country for the death of a knight that was kin unto the good knight Sir Launcelot; wherefore Sir Blamore de Ganis, brother to Sir Bleoberis hath appealed me to fight with him, outher to find a knight in my stead. And well I wot, said the king, these that are come of King Ban’s blood, as Sir Launcelot and these other, are passing good knights, and hard men for to win in battle as any that I know now living. Sir, said Sir Tristram, for the good lordship ye showed me in Ireland, and for my lady your daughter’s sake, La Beale Isoud, I will take the battle for you upon this condition that ye shall grant me two things: that one is that ye shall swear to me that ye are in the right, that ye were never consenting to the knight’s death; Sir, then said Sir Tristram, when that I have done this battle, if God give me grace that I speed, that ye shall give me a reward, what thing reasonable that I will ask of you. So God me help, said the king, ye shall have whatsomever ye will ask. It is well said, said Sir Tristram.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001531\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001531\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001532\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001532\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001533\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001533\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br>\\nHow Sir Tristram fought for Sir Anguish and overcame his adversary, and how his adversary would never yield him.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001534\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001534\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001535\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001535\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Now make your answer that your champion is ready, for I shall die in your quarrel rather than to be recreant.

Sir, said the knight, this is the old custom of this castle, that when a knight cometh here he must needs fight with our lord, and he that is weaker must lose his head. And when that is done, if his lady that he bringeth be fouler than our lord’s wife, she must lose her head: and if she be fairer proved than is our lady, then shall the lady of this castle lose her head. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, this is a foul custom and a shameful. But one advantage have I, said Sir Tristram, I have a lady is fair enough, fairer saw I never in all my life-days, and I doubt not for lack of beauty she shall not lose her head; and rather than I should lose my head I will fight for it on a fair field. Wherefore, sir knight, I pray you tell your lord that I will be ready as to-morn with my lady, and myself to do battle, if it be so I may have my horse and mine armour. Sir, said that knight, I undertake that your desire shall be sped right well. And then he said: Take your rest, and look that ye be up betimes and make you ready and your lady, for ye shall want no thing that you behoveth. And therewith he departed, and on the morn betimes that same knight came to Sir Tristram, and fetched him out and his lady, and brought him horse and armour that was his own, and bade him make him ready to the field, for all the estates and commons of that lordship were there ready to behold that battle and judgment.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001565\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001565\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001566\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001566\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then came Sir Breunor, the lord of that castle, with his lady in his hand, muffled, and asked Sir Tristram where was his lady: For an thy lady be fairer than mine, with thy sword smite off my lady’s head; and if my lady be fairer than thine, with my sword I must strike off her head. And if I may win thee, yet shall thy lady be mine, and thou shalt lose thy head. Sir, said Tristram, this is a foul custom and horrible; and rather than my lady should lose her head, yet had I liefer lose my head. Nay, nay, said Sir Breunor, the ladies shall be first showed together, and the one shall have her judgment. Nay, I will not so, said Sir Tristram, for here is none that will give righteous judgment. But I doubt not, said Sir Tristram, my lady is fairer than thine, and that will I prove and make good with my hand. And whosomever he be that will say the contrary I will prove it on his head. And therewith Sir Tristram showed La Beale Isoud, and turned her thrice about with his naked sword in his hand. And when Sir Breunor saw that, he did the same wise turn his lady. But when Sir Breunor beheld La Beale Isoud, him thought he saw never a fairer lady, and then he dread his lady’s head should be off. And so all the people that were there present gave judgment that La Beale Isoud was the fairer lady and the better made. How now, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were pity that my lady should lose her head, but because thou and she of long time have used this wicked custom, and by you both have many good knights and ladies been destroyed, for that cause it were no loss to destroy you both. So God me help, said Sir Breunor, for to say the sooth, thy lady is fairer than mine, and that me sore repenteth. And so I hear the people privily say, for of all women I saw none so fair; and therefore, an thou wilt slay my lady, I doubt not but I shall slay thee and have thy lady. Thou shalt win her, said Sir Tristram, as dear as ever knight won lady. And because of thine own judgment, as thou wouldst have done to my lady if that she had been fouler, and because of the evil custom, give me thy lady, said Sir Tristram. And therewithal Sir Tristram strode unto him and took his lady from him, and with an awk stroke he smote off her head clean.

Let be, said Sir Galahad, be ye not so hardy to touch him, for I have given this knight his life. That is your shame, said the King with the Hundred Knights; hath he not slain your father and your mother? As for that, said Sir Galahad, I may not wite him greatly, for my father had him in prison, and enforced him to do battle with him; and my father had such a custom that was a shameful custom, that what knight came there to ask harbour his lady must needs die but if she were fairer than my mother; and if my father overcame that knight he must needs die. This was a shameful custom and usage, a knight for his harbour-asking to have such harbourage. And for this custom I would never draw about him. So God me help, said the King, this was a shameful custom. Truly, said Sir Galahad, so seemed me; and meseemed it had been great pity that this knight should have been slain, for I dare say he is the noblest man that beareth life, but if it were Sir Launcelot du Lake. Now, fair knight, said Sir Galahad, I require thee tell me thy name, and of whence thou art, and whither thou wilt. Sir, he said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and from King Mark of Cornwall I was sent on message unto King Anguish of Ireland, for to fetch his daughter to be his wife, and here she is ready to go with me into Cornwall, and her name is La Beale Isoud. And, Sir Tristram, said Sir Galahad, the haut prince, well be ye found in these marches, and so ye will promise me to go unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, and accompany with him, ye shall go where ye will, and your fair lady with you; and I shall promise you never in all my days shall such customs be used in this castle as have been used. Sir, said Sir Tristram, now I let you wit, so God me help, I weened ye had been Sir Launcelot du Lake when I saw you first, and therefore I dread you the more; and sir, I promise you, said Sir Tristram, as soon as I may I will see Sir Launcelot and in fellowship me with him; for of all the knights of the world I most desire his fellowship.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001585\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001585\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001586\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001586\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001587\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001587\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>\\nHow Sir Launcelot met with Sir Carados bearing away Sir Gawaine, and of the rescue of Sir Gawaine.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001588\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001588\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001589\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001589\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And then Sir Tristram took his leave when he saw his time, and took the sea. And in the meanwhile word came unto Sir Launcelot and to Sir Tristram that Sir Carados, the mighty king, that was made like a giant, fought with Sir Gawaine, and gave him such strokes that he swooned in his saddle, and after that he took him by the collar and pulled him out of his saddle, and fast bound him to the saddle-bow, and so rode his way with him toward his castle. And as he rode, by fortune Sir Launcelot met with Sir Carados, and anon he knew Sir Gawaine that lay bound after him. Ah, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine, how stands it with you? Never so hard, said Sir Gawaine, unless that ye help me, for so God me help, without ye rescue me I know no knight that may, but outher you or Sir Tristram. Wherefore Sir Launcelot was heavy of Sir Gawaine’s words. And then Sir Launcelot bade Sir Carados: Lay down that knight and fight with me. Thou art but a fool, said Sir Carados, for I will serve you in the same wise. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, spare me not, for I warn thee I will not spare thee. And then he bound Sir Gawaine hand and foot, and so threw him to the ground. And then he gat his spear of his squire, and departed from Sir Launcelot to fetch his course. And so either met with other, and brake their spears to their hands; and then they pulled out swords, and hurtled together on horseback more than an hour. And at the last Sir Launcelot smote Sir Carados such a buffet upon the helm that it pierced his brain-pan. So then Sir Launcelot took Sir Carados by the collar and pulled him under his horse’s feet, and then he alighted and pulled off his helm and struck off his head. And then Sir Launcelot unbound Sir Gawaine. So this same tale was told to Sir Galahad and to Sir Tristram:—here may ye hear the nobleness that followeth Sir Launcelot. Alas, said Sir Tristram, an I had not this message in hand with this fair lady, truly I would never stint or I had found Sir Launcelot.

Then was there great jousts and great tourneying, and many lords and ladies were at that feast, and Sir Tristram was most praised of all other. Thus dured the feast long, and after the feast was done, within a little while after, by the assent of two ladies that were with Queen Isoud, they ordained for hate and envy for to destroy Dame Bragwaine, that was maiden and lady unto La Beale Isoud; and she was sent into the forest for to fetch herbs, and there she was met, and bound feet and hand to a tree, and so she was bounden three days. And by fortune, Sir Palamides found Dame Bragwaine, and there he delivered her from the death, and brought her to a nunnery there beside, for to be recovered. When Isoud the queen missed her maiden, wit ye well she was right heavy as ever was any queen, for of all earthly women she loved her best: the cause was for she came with her out of her country. And so upon a day Queen Isoud walked into the forest to put away her thoughts, and there she went herself unto a well and made great moan. And suddenly there came Palamides to her, and had heard all her complaint, and said: Madam Isoud, an ye will grant me my boon, I shall bring to you Dame Bragwaine safe and sound. And the queen was so glad of his proffer that suddenly unadvised she granted all his asking. Well, Madam, said Palamides, I trust to your promise, and if ye will abide here half an hour I shall bring her to you. I shall abide you, said La Beale Isoud. And Sir Palamides rode forth his way to that nunnery, and lightly he came again with Dame Bragwaine; but by her good will she would not have come again, because for love of the queen she stood in adventure of her life. Notwithstanding, half against her will, she went with Sir Palamides unto the queen. And when the queen saw her she was passing glad. Now, Madam, said Palamides, remember upon your promise, for I have fulfilled my promise. Sir Palamides, said the queen, I wot not what is your desire, but I will that ye wit, howbeit I promised you largely, I thought none evil, nor I warn you none evil will I do. Madam, said Sir Palamides, as at this time, ye shall not know my desire, but before my lord your husband there shall ye know that I will have my desire that ye have promised me.

Alas, said Sir Tristram, I am this day shamed. Then he cried to Gouvernail his man: Haste thee that I were armed and on horseback, for well I wot Lambegus hath no might nor strength to withstand Sir Palamides: alas that I have not been in his stead! So anon as he was armed and horsed Sir Tristram and Gouvernail rode after into the forest, and within a while he found his knight Lambegus almost wounded to the death; and Sir Tristram bare him to a forester, and charged him to keep him well. And then he rode forth, and there he found Sir Adtherp sore wounded, and he told him how the queen would have drowned herself had he not been, and how for her sake and love he had taken upon him to do battle with Sir Palamides. Where is my lady? said Sir Tristram. Sir, said the knight, she is sure enough within my castle, an she can hold her within it. Gramercy, said Sir Tristram, of thy great goodness. And so he rode till he came nigh to that castle; and then Sir Tristram saw where Sir Palamides sat at the gate sleeping, and his horse pastured fast afore him. Now go thou, Gouvernail, said Sir Tristram, and bid him awake, and make him ready. So Gouvernail rode unto him and said: Sir Palamides, arise, and take to thee thine harness. But he was in such a study he heard not what Gouvernail said. So Gouvernail came again and told Sir Tristram he slept, or else he was mad. Go thou again, said Sir Tristram, and bid him arise, and tell him that I am here, his mortal foe. So Gouvernail rode again and put upon him the butt of his spear, and said: Sir Palamides, make thee ready, for wit ye well Sir Tristram hoveth yonder, and sendeth thee word he is thy mortal foe. And therewithal Sir Palamides arose stilly, without words, and gat his horse, and saddled him and bridled him, and lightly he leapt upon, and gat his spear in his hand, and either feutred their spears and hurtled fast together; and there Tristram smote down Sir Palamides over his horse’s tail. Then lightly Sir Palamides put his shield afore him and drew his sword. And there began strong battle on both parts, for both they fought for the love of one lady, and ever she lay on the walls and beheld them how they fought out of measure, and either were wounded passing sore, but Palamides was much sorer wounded. Thus they fought tracing and traversing more than two hours, that well-nigh for dole and sorrow La Beale Isoud swooned. Alas, she said, that one I loved and yet do, and the other I love not, yet it were great pity that I should see Sir Palamides slain; for well I know by that time the end be done Sir Palamides is but a dead knight: because he is not christened I would be loath that he should die a Saracen. And therewithal she came down and besought Sir Tristram to fight no more. Ah, madam, said he, what mean you, will ye have me shamed? Well ye know I will be ruled by you. I will not your dishonour, said La Beale Isoud, but I would that ye would for my sake spare this unhappy Saracen Palamides. Madam, said Sir Tristram, I will leave fighting at this time for your sake. Then she said to Sir Palamides: This shall be your charge, that thou shalt go out of this country while I am therein. I will obey your commandment, said Sir Palamides, the which is sore against my will. Then take thy way, said La Beale Isoud, unto the court of King Arthur, and there recommend me unto Queen Guenever, and tell her that I send her word that there be within this land but four lovers, that is, Sir Launcelot du Lake and Queen Guenever, and Sir Tristram de Liones and Queen Isoud.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001609\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001609\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001610\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001610\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001611\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001611\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XXXII.<br>\\nHow Sir Tristram brought Queen Isoud home, and of the debate of King Mark and Sir Tristram.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001612\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001612\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001613\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001613\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And so Sir Palamides departed with great heaviness.

And when he began he fared so with the thirty knights that there was not one of them but that he gave him a fall, and some of them were sore hurt. I marvel, said King Mark, what knight he is that doth such deeds of arms. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I know him well for a noble knight as few now be living, and his name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. It were great shame, said the king, that he should go thus away, unless that some of you meet with him better. Sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were no worship for a noble man to have ado with him: and for because at this time he hath done over much for any mean knight living, therefore, as meseemeth, it were great shame and villainy to tempt him any more at this time, insomuch as he and his horse are weary both; for the deeds of arms that he hath done this day, an they be well considered, it were enough for Sir Launcelot du Lake. As for that, said King Mark, I require you, as ye love me and my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud, take your arms and joust with Sir Lamorak de Galis. Sir, said Sir Tristram, ye bid me do a thing that is against knighthood, and well I can deem that I shall give him a fall, for it is no mastery, for my horse and I be fresh both, and so is not his horse and he; and wit ye well that he will take it for great unkindness, for ever one good knight is loath to take another at disadvantage; but because I will not displease you, as ye require me so will I do, and obey your commandment.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001621\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001621\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001622\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001622\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And so Sir Tristram armed him and took his horse, and put him forth, and there Sir Lamorak met him mightily, and what with the might of his own spear, and of Sir Tristram’s spear, Sir Lamorak’s horse fell to the earth, and he sitting in the saddle.

And because of the Queen Guenever, and in the despite of Sir Launcelot, this horn was sent unto King Arthur; and by force Sir Lamorak made that knight to tell all the cause why he bare that horn.

So the knight went his way unto King Mark, and brought him that rich horn, and said that Sir Lamorak sent it him, and thereto he told him the virtue of that horn.

Well, said he, an it were to do again, so would I do, for I had liefer strife and debate fell in King Mark’s court rather than Arthur’s court, for the honour of both courts be not alike. As to that, said Sir Tristram, I know well; but that that was done it was for despite of me, but all your malice, I thank God, hurt not greatly. Therefore, said Sir Tristram, ye shall leave all your malice, and so will I, and let us assay how we may win worship between you and me upon this giant Sir Nabon le Noire that is lord of this island, to destroy him. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, now I understand your knighthood, it may not be false that all men say, for of your bounty, noblesse, and worship, of all knights ye are peerless, and for your courtesy and gentleness I showed you ungentleness, and that now me repenteth.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001664\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001664\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001665\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001665\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001666\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001666\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br>\\nHow Sir Tristram fought with Sir Nabon, and overcame him, and made Sir Segwarides lord of the isle.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001667\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001667\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001668\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001668\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>In the meantime there came word that Sir Nabon had made a cry that all the people of that isle should be at his castle the fifth day after.

And then Sir Lamorak went betwixt them, and asked them why they would slay that one knight, and said it was shame, four against one. Thou shalt well wit, said the four knights, that he is false. That is your tale, said Sir Lamorak, and when I hear him also speak, I will say as ye say. Then said Lamorak: Ah, knight, can ye not excuse you, but that ye are a false knight. Sir, said he, yet can I excuse me both with my word and with my hands, that I will make good upon one of the best of them, my body to his body. Then spake they all at once: We will not jeopardy our bodies as for thee. But wit thou well, they said, an King Arthur were here himself, it should not lie in his power to save his life. That is too much said, said Sir Lamorak, but many speak behind a man more than they will say to his face; and because of your words ye shall understand that I am one of the simplest of King Arthur’s court; in the worship of my lord now do your best, and in despite of you I shall rescue him. And then they lashed all at once to Sir Lamorak, but anon at two strokes Sir Lamorak had slain two of them, and then the other two fled. So then Sir Lamorak turned again to that knight, and asked him his name. Sir, he said, my name is Sir Frol of the Out Isles.

Sir, said Sir Lamorak and Sir Gaheris, it were well done to make him knight; for him beseemeth well of person and of countenance, that he shall prove a good man, and a good knight, and a mighty; for, Sir, an ye be remembered, even such one was Sir Launcelot du Lake when he came first into this court, and full few of us knew from whence he came; and now is he proved the man of most worship in the world; and all your court and all your Round Table is by Sir Launcelot worshipped and amended more than by any knight now living. That is truth, said the king, and to-morrow at your request I shall make him knight.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001701\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001701\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001702\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001702\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So on the morrow there was an hart found, and thither rode King Arthur with a company of his knights to slay the hart.

Then was it told the queen how the young man that Sir Kay named by scorn La Cote Male Taile had slain the lion. With that the king came home. And when the queen told him of that adventure, he was well pleased, and said: Upon pain of mine head he shall prove a noble man and a faithful knight, and true of his promise: then the king forthwithal made him knight.

So this knight that ought this shield saw none other way but he must die; and then he commanded me to bear this shield to the court of King Arthur, he requiring and praying some good knight to take this shield, and that he would fulfil the quest that he was in. Now what say ye to this quest? said King Arthur; is there any of you here that will take upon him to wield this shield? Then was there not one that would speak one word.

Then she smote down her head, and said little. By my head, said Sir Mordred to the damosel, ye are greatly to blame so to rebuke him, for I warn you plainly he is a good knight, and I doubt not but he shall prove a noble knight; but as yet he may not yet sit sure on horseback, for he that shall be a good horseman it must come of usage and exercise. But when he cometh to the strokes of his sword he is then noble and mighty, and that saw Sir Bleoberis and Sir Palomides, for wit ye well they are wily men of arms, and anon they know when they see a young knight by his riding, how they are sure to give him a fall from his horse or a great buffet. But for the most part they will not light on foot with young knights, for they are wight and strongly armed. For in likewise Sir Launcelot du Lake, when he was first made knight, he was often put to the worse upon horseback, but ever upon foot he recovered his renown, and slew and defoiled many knights of the Round Table. And therefore the rebukes that Sir Launcelot did unto many knights causeth them that be men of prowess to beware; for often I have seen the old proved knights rebuked and slain by them that were but young beginners. Thus they rode sure talking by the way together.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001726\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001726\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001727\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001727\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Here leave we off a while of this tale, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du Lake.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001728\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001728\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001729\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001729\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001730\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001730\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER V.<br>\\nHow Sir Launcelot came to the court and heard of La Cote Male Taile, and how he followed after him, and how La Cote Male Taile was prisoner.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001731\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001731\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001732\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001732\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>That when he was come to the court of King Arthur, then heard he tell of the young knight La Cote Male Taile, how he slew the lion, and how he took upon him the adventure of the black shield, the which was named at that time the hardiest adventure of the world.

For ever I supposed that he had been too young and too tender to take upon him these adventures.

And as for you, Sir Plenorius, I will undertake, said Sir Launcelot, at the next feast, so there be a place voided, that ye shall be Knight of the Round Table. Sir, said Plenorius, at the next feast of Pentecost I will be at Arthur’s court, and at that time I will be guided and ruled as King Arthur and ye will have me.

And this knight that sat at the well seemed by his countenance to be passing heavy. Then Sir Tristram rode near him and said: Fair knight, why sit ye so drooping? ye seem to be a knight-errant by your arms and harness, and therefore dress you to joust with one of us, or with both.

So they met together, and there Sir Kehydius had a fall, and was sore wounded on high above the paps. Then Sir Tristram said: Knight, that is well jousted, now make you ready unto me. I am ready, said the knight. And then that knight took a greater spear in his hand, and encountered with Sir Tristram, and there by great force that knight smote down Sir Tristram from his horse and had a great fall. Then Sir Tristram was sore ashamed, and lightly he avoided his horse, and put his shield afore his shoulder, and drew his sword. And then Sir Tristram required that knight of his knighthood to alight upon foot and fight with him. I will well, said the knight; and so he alighted upon foot, and avoided his horse, and cast his shield upon his shoulder, and drew his sword, and there they fought a long battle together full nigh two hours.

Here men may understand that be of worship, that he was never formed that all times might stand, but sometime he was put to the worse by mal-fortune; and at sometime the worse knight put the better knight to a rebuke.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001788\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001788\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001789\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001789\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak gat Sir Kehydius upon a shield betwixt them both, and led him to a forester’s lodge, and there they gave him in charge to keep him well, and with him they abode three days.

And then said Sir Tristram to Sir Lamorak: I require you if ye hap to meet with Sir Palomides, say him that he shall find me at the same well where I met him, and there I, Sir Tristram, shall prove whether he be better knight than I. And so either departed from other a sundry way, and Sir Tristram rode nigh thereas was Sir Kehydius; and Sir Lamorak rode until he came to a chapel, and there he put his horse unto pasture. And anon there came Sir Meliagaunce, that was King Bagdemagus’ son, and he there put his horse to pasture, and was not ware of Sir Lamorak; and then this knight Sir Meliagaunce made his moan of the love that he had to Queen Guenever, and there he made a woful complaint. All this heard Sir Lamorak, and on the morn Sir Lamorak took his horse and rode unto the forest, and there he met with two knights hoving under the wood-shaw. Fair knights, said Sir Lamorak, what do ye hoving here and watching? and if ye be knights-errant that will joust, lo I am ready. Nay, sir knight, they said, not so, we abide not here to joust with you, but we lie here in await of a knight that slew our brother. What knight was that, said Sir Lamorak, that you would fain meet withal? Sir, they said, it is Sir Launcelot that slew our brother, and if ever we may meet with him he shall not escape, but we shall slay him. Ye take upon you a great charge, said Sir Lamorak, for Sir Launcelot is a noble proved knight. As for that we doubt not, for there nis none of us but we are good enough for him. I will not believe that, said Sir Lamorak, for I heard never yet of no knight the days of my life but Sir Launcelot was too big for him.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001790\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001790\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001791\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001791\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001792\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001792\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>\\nHow Sir Lamorak met with Sir Meliagaunce, and fought together for the beauty of Dame Guenever.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001793\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001793\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001794\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001794\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Right so as they stood talking thus Sir Lamorak was ware how Sir Launcelot came riding straight toward them; then Sir Lamorak saluted him, and he him again.

Then either departed from other, and Sir Lamorak rode again thereas he left the two knights, and then he found them hid in the leaved wood. Fie on you, said Sir Lamorak, false cowards, pity and shame it is that any of you should take the high order of knighthood. So Sir Lamorak departed from them, and within a while he met with Sir Meliagaunce. And then Sir Lamorak asked him why he loved Queen Guenever as he did: For I was not far from you when ye made your complaint by the chapel. Did ye so? said Sir Meliagaunce, then will I abide by it: I love Queen Guenever, what will ye with it? I will prove and make good that she is the fairest lady and most of beauty in the world. As to that, said Sir Lamorak, I say nay thereto, for Queen Morgawse of Orkney, mother to Sir Gawaine, and his mother is the fairest queen and lady that beareth the life. That is not so, said Sir Meliagaunce, and that will I prove with my hands upon thy body. Will ye so? said Sir Lamorak, and in a better quarrel keep I not to fight. Then they departed either from other in great wrath. And then they came riding together as it had been thunder, and either smote other so sore that their horses fell backward to the earth. And then they avoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their swords. And then they hurtled together as wild boars, and thus they fought a great while.

I praised my lady, Queen Guenever, and said she was the fairest lady of the world, and Sir Lamorak said nay thereto, for he said Queen Morgawse of Orkney was fairer than she and more of beauty. Ah, Sir Lamorak, why sayest thou so? it is not thy part to dispraise thy princess that thou art under her obeissance, and we all. And therewith he alighted on foot, and said: For this quarrel, make thee ready, for I will prove upon thee that Queen Guenever is the fairest lady and most of bounty in the world. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I am loath to have ado with you in this quarrel, for every man thinketh his own lady fairest; and though I praise the lady that I love most ye should not be wroth; for though my lady, Queen Guenever, be fairest in your eye, wit ye well Queen Morgawse of Orkney is fairest in mine eye, and so every knight thinketh his own lady fairest; and wit ye well, sir, ye are the man in the world except Sir Tristram that I am most loathest to have ado withal, but, an ye will needs fight with me I shall endure you as long as I may. Then spake Sir Bleoberis and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, I wist you never so misadvised as ye are now, for Sir Lamorak sayeth you but reason and knightly; for I warn you I have a lady, and methinketh that she is the fairest lady of the world. Were this a great reason that ye should be wroth with me for such language? And well ye wot, that Sir Lamorak is as noble a knight as I know, and he hath ought you and us ever good will, and therefore I pray you be good friends. Then Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Lamorak. I pray you forgive me mine evil will, and if I was misadvised I will amend it. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, the amends is soon made betwixt you and me.

So when the king was gone with her many of his knights followed after King Arthur when they missed him, as Sir Launcelot, Brandiles, and many other; and when she had brought him to her tower she desired him to lie by her; and then the king remembered him of his lady, and would not lie by her for no craft that she could do. Then every day she would make him ride into that forest with his own knights, to the intent to have had King Arthur slain.

O my lord Sir Tristram, she said, well be ye met, and blessed be the time that I have met with you; for this same day, and within these two hours, shall be done the foulest deed that ever was done in this land. O fair damosel, said Sir Tristram, may I amend it. Come on with me, she said, and that in all the haste ye may, for ye shall see the most worshipfullest knight of the world hard bestead. Then said Sir Tristram: I am ready to help such a noble man. He is neither better nor worse, said the Lady of the Lake, but the noble King Arthur himself. God defend, said Sir Tristram, that ever he should be in such distress. Then they rode together a great pace, until they came to a little turret or castle; and underneath that castle they saw a knight standing upon foot fighting with two knights; and so Sir Tristram beheld them, and at the last the two knights smote down the one knight, and that one of them unlaced his helm to have slain him. And the Lady Annowre gat King Arthur’s sword in her hand to have stricken off his head. And therewithal came Sir Tristram with all his might, crying: Traitress, traitress, leave that. And anon there Sir Tristram smote the one of the knights through the body that he fell dead; and then he rashed to the other and smote his back asunder; and in the meanwhile the Lady of the Lake cried to King Arthur: Let not that false lady escape. Then King Arthur overtook her, and with the same sword he smote off her head, and the Lady of the Lake took up her head and hung it up by the hair of her saddle-bow.

And when he had met with him he made great sorrow, insomuch that he fell down off his horse in a swoon, and in such sorrow he was in three days and three nights. Then at the last Sir Tristram sent unto the court by Sir Fergus, for to spere what tidings. And so as he rode by the way he met with a damosel that came from Sir Palomides, to know and seek how Sir Tristram did. Then Sir Fergus told her how he was almost out of his mind. Alas, said the damosel, where shall I find him? In such a place, said Sir Fergus. Then Sir Fergus found Queen Isoud sick in her bed, making the greatest dole that ever any earthly woman made. And when the damosel found Sir Tristram she made great dole because she might not amend him, for the more she made of him the more was his pain. And at the last Sir Tristram took his horse and rode away from her. And then was it three days or that she could find him, and then she brought him meat and drink, but he would none; and then another time Sir Tristram escaped away from the damosel, and it happed him to ride by the same castle where Sir Palomides and Sir Tristram did battle when La Beale Isoud departed them. And there by fortune the damosel met with Sir Tristram again, making the greatest dole that ever earthly creature made; and she yede to the lady of that castle and told her of the misadventure of Sir Tristram. Alas, said the lady of that castle, where is my lord, Sir Tristram? Right here by your castle, said the damosel. In good time, said the lady, is he so nigh me; he shall have meat and drink of the best; and an harp I have of his whereupon he taught me, for of goodly harping he beareth the prize in the world. So this lady and damosel brought him meat and drink, but he ate little thereof. Then upon a night he put his horse from him, and then he unlaced his armour, and then Sir Tristram would go into the wilderness, and brast down the trees and boughs; and otherwhile when he found the harp that the lady sent him, then would he harp, and play thereupon and weep together. And sometime when Sir Tristram was in the wood that the lady wist not where he was, then would she sit her down and play upon that harp: then would Sir Tristram come to that harp, and hearken thereto, and sometime he would harp himself. Thus he there endured a quarter of a year. Then at the last he ran his way, and she wist not where he was become. And then was he naked and waxed lean and poor of flesh; and so he fell in the fellowship of herdmen and shepherds, and daily they would give him some of their meat and drink. And when he did any shrewd deed they would beat him with rods, and so they clipped him with shears and made him like a fool.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001831\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001831\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001832\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001832\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001833\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001833\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>\\nHow Sir Tristram soused Dagonet in a well, and how Palomides sent a damosel to seek Tristram, and how Palomides met with King Mark.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001834\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001834\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001835\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001835\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And upon a day Dagonet, King Arthur’s fool, came into Cornwall with two squires with him; and as they rode through that forest they came by a fair well where Sir Tristram was wont to be; and the weather was hot, and they alighted to drink of that well, and in the meanwhile their horses brake loose. Right so Sir Tristram came unto them, and first he soused Sir Dagonet in that well, and after his squires, and thereat laughed the shepherds; and forthwithal he ran after their horses and brought them again one by one, and right so, wet as they were, he made them leap up and ride their ways. Thus Sir Tristram endured there an half year naked, and would never come in town nor village. The meanwhile the damosel that Sir Palomides sent to seek Sir Tristram, she yede unto Sir Palomides and told him all the mischief that Sir Tristram endured. Alas, said Sir Palomides, it is great pity that ever so noble a knight should be so mischieved for the love of a lady; but nevertheless, I will go and seek him, and comfort him an I may. Then a little before that time La Beale Isoud had commanded Sir Kehydius out of the country of Cornwall. So Sir Kehydius departed with a dolorous heart, and by adventure he met with Sir Palomides, and they enfellowshipped together; and either complained to other of their hot love that they loved La Beale Isoud. Now let us, said Sir Palomides, seek Sir Tristram, that loved her as well as we, and let us prove whether we may recover him. So they rode into that forest, and three days and three nights they would never take their lodging, but ever sought Sir Tristram.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001836\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001836\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001837\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001837\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And upon a time, by adventure, they met with King Mark that was ridden from his men all alone.

Then they rode together and fought long, and at the last Sir Tristram doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Palomides aback more than three strides.

So there was a knight in that priory that hight Pellinore, and he desired to wit the name of Sir Tristram, but in no wise he could not; and so Sir Tristram departed and left Sir Dinadan in the priory, for he was so weary and so sore bruised that he might not ride. Then this knight, Sir Pellinore, said to Sir Dinadan: Sithen that ye will not tell me that knight’s name I will ride after him and make him to tell me his name, or he shall die therefore. Beware, sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, for an ye follow him ye shall repent it. So that knight, Sir Pellinore, rode after Sir Tristram and required him of jousts. Then Sir Tristram smote him down and wounded him through the shoulder, and so he passed on his way. And on the next day following Sir Tristram met with pursuivants, and they told him that there was made a great cry of tournament between King Carados of Scotland and the King of North Wales, and either should joust against other at the Castle of Maidens; and these pursuivants sought all the country after the good knights, and in especial King Carados let make seeking for Sir Launcelot du Lake, and the King of Northgalis let seek after Sir Tristram de Liones. And at that time Sir Tristram thought to be at that jousts; and so by adventure they met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous; and Sir Kay required Sir Tristram to joust, and Sir Tristram in a manner refused him, because he would not be hurt nor bruised against the great jousts that should be before the Castle of Maidens, and therefore thought to repose him and to rest him. And alway Sir Kay cried: Sir knight of Cornwall, joust with me, or else yield thee to me as recreant. When Sir Tristram heard him say so he turned to him, and then Sir Kay refused him and turned his back. Then Sir Tristram said: As I find thee I shall take thee. Then Sir Kay turned with evil will, and Sir Tristram smote Sir Kay down, and so he rode forth.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001886\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001886\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001887\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001887\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Then Sir Sagramore le Desirous rode after Sir Tristram, and made him to joust with him, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le Desirous from his horse, and rode his way; and the same day he met with a damosel that told him that he should win great worship of a knight adventurous that did much harm in all that country.

Now, said Sir Gawaine, I know your false treason, and through all places where that I ride men shall know of your false treason; and now let see, said Sir Gawaine, whether ye dare come out of your castle, ye thirty knights.

So Sir Launcelot departed from him and thought to meet with Sir Tristram, and so he rode with his sword drawn in his hand to seek Sir Tristram; and then he espied him how he hurled here and there, and at every stroke Sir Tristram wellnigh smote down a knight. O mercy Jesu! said the king, sith the times I bare arms saw I never no knight do so marvellous deeds of arms. And if I should set upon this knight, said Sir Launcelot to himself, I did shame to myself, and therewithal Sir Launcelot put up his sword. And then the King with the Hundred Knights and an hundred more of North Wales set upon the twenty of Sir Launcelot’s kin: and they twenty knights held them ever together as wild swine, and none would fail other. And so when Sir Tristram beheld the noblesse of these twenty knights he marvelled of their good deeds, for he saw by their fare and by their rule that they had liefer die than avoid the field. Now Jesu, said Sir Tristram, well may he be valiant and full of prowess that hath such a sort of noble knights unto his kin, and full like is he to be a noble man that is their leader and governor. He meant it by Sir Launcelot du Lake. So when Sir Tristram had beholden them long he thought shame to see two hundred knights battering upon twenty knights. Then Sir Tristram rode unto the King with the Hundred Knights and said: Sir, leave your fighting with those twenty knights, for ye win no worship of them, ye be so many and they so few; and wit ye well they will not out of the field I see by their cheer and countenance; and worship get ye none an ye slay them. Therefore leave your fighting with them, for I to increase my worship I will ride to the twenty knights and help them with all my might and power.

Nay, nay, said Sir Tristram, Dinadan never dread thee, for I am heart-whole, and of this wound I shall soon be whole, by the mercy of God. By that Sir Dinadan was ware where came Palomides riding straight upon them. And then Sir Tristram was ware that Sir Palomides came to have destroyed him. And so Sir Dinadan gave him warning, and said: Sir Tristram, my lord, ye are so sore wounded that ye may not have ado with him, therefore I will ride against him and do to him what I may, and if I be slain ye may pray for my soul; and in the meanwhile ye may withdraw you and go into the castle, or in the forest, that he shall not meet with you. Sir Tristram smiled and said: I thank you, Sir Dinadan, of your good will, but ye shall wit that I am able to handle him. And then anon hastily he armed him, and took his horse, and a great spear in his hand, and said to Sir Dinadan: Adieu; and rode toward Sir Palomides a soft pace. Then when Sir Palomides saw that, he made countenance to amend his horse, but he did it for this cause, for he abode Sir Gaheris that came after him. And when he was come he rode toward Sir Tristram. Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides, and required him to joust with him; and if he smote down Sir Palomides he would do no more to him; and if it so happened that Sir Palomides smote down Sir Tristram, he bade him do his utterance. So they were accorded. Then they met together, and Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides that he had a grievous fall, so that he lay still as he had been dead. And then Sir Tristram ran upon Sir Gaheris, and he would not have jousted; but whether he would or not Sir Tristram smote him over his horse’s croup, that he lay still as though he had been dead. And then Sir Tristram rode his way and left Sir Persides’ squire within the pavilions, and Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to an old knight’s place to lodge them. And that old knight had five sons at the tournament, for whom he prayed God heartily for their coming home. And so, as the French book saith, they came home all five well beaten.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001961\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001961\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001962\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001962\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>And when Sir Tristram departed into the forest Sir Launcelot held alway the stour like hard, as a man araged that took no heed to himself, and wit ye well there was many a noble knight against him.

So God me help, said King Arthur, I am more heavy that I cannot meet with him than for all the hurts that all my knights have had at the tournament. Right so came Sir Gaheris and told King Arthur how Sir Tristram had smitten down Sir Palomides, and it was at Sir Palomides’ own request. Alas, said King Arthur, that was great dishonour to Sir Palomides, inasmuch as Sir Tristram was sore wounded, and now may we all, kings, and knights, and men of worship, say that Sir Tristram may be called a noble knight, and one of the best knights that ever I saw the days of my life. For I will that ye all, kings and knights, know, said King Arthur, that I never saw knight do so marvellously as he hath done these three days; for he was the first that began and that longest held on, save this last day. And though he was hurt, it was a manly adventure of two noble knights, and when two noble men encounter needs must the one have the worse, like as God will suffer at that time. As for me, said Sir Launcelot, for all the lands that ever my father left me I would not have hurt Sir Tristram an I had known him at that time; that I hurt him was for I saw not his shield. For an I had seen his black shield, I would not have meddled with him for many causes; for late he did as much for me as ever did knight, and that is well known that he had ado with thirty knights, and no help save Sir Dinadan. And one thing shall I promise, said Sir Launcelot, Sir Palomides shall repent it as in his unkindly dealing for to follow that noble knight that I by mishap hurted thus. Sir Launcelot said all the worship that might be said by Sir Tristram. Then King Arthur made a great feast to all that would come.

Right so came a damosel even by Sir Palomides, that was sent from Sir Gawaine and his brother unto Sir Mordred, that lay sick in the same place with that old knight where Sir Tristram was. For, as the French book saith, Sir Persides hurt so Sir Mordred a ten days afore; and had it not been for the love of Sir Gawaine and his brother, Sir Persides had slain Sir Mordred. And so this damosel came by Sir Palomides, and she and he had language together, the which pleased neither of them; and so the damosel rode her ways till she came to the old knight’s place, and there she told that old knight how she met with the woodest knight by adventure that ever she met withal. What bare he in his shield? said Sir Tristram. It was indented with white and black, said the damosel. Ah, said Sir Tristram, that was Sir Palomides, the good knight. For well I know him, said Sir Tristram, for one of the best knights living in this realm. Then that old knight took a little hackney, and rode for Sir Palomides, and brought him unto his own manor; and full well knew Sir Tristram Sir Palomides, but he said but little, for at that time Sir Tristram was walking upon his feet, and well amended of his hurts; and always when Sir Palomides saw Sir Tristram he would behold him full marvellously, and ever him seemed that he had seen him. Then would he say unto Sir Dinadan: An ever I may meet with Sir Tristram he shall not escape mine hands. I marvel, said Sir Dinadan, that ye boast behind Sir Tristram, for it is but late that he was in your hands, and ye in his hands; why would ye not hold him when ye had him? for I saw myself twice or thrice that ye gat but little worship of Sir Tristram. Then was Sir Palomides ashamed.

And some yede into Cornwall; and by adventure Sir Gaheris, nephew unto King Arthur, came unto King Mark, and there he was well received and sat at King Mark’s own table and ate of his own mess. Then King Mark asked Sir Gaheris what tidings there were in the realm of Logris. Sir, said Sir Gaheris, the king reigneth as a noble knight; and now but late there was a great jousts and tournament as ever I saw any in the realm of Logris, and the most noble knights were at that jousts. But there was one knight that did marvellously three days, and he bare a black shield, and of all knights that ever I saw he proved the best knight. Then, said King Mark, that was Sir Launcelot, or Sir Palomides the paynim. Not so, said Sir Gheris, for both Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides were on the contrary party against the Knight with the Black Shield. Then was it Sir Tristram, said the king. Yea, said Sir Gaheris. And therewithal the king smote down his head, and in his heart he feared sore that Sir Tristram should get him such worship in the realm of Logris wherethrough that he himself should not be able to withstand him. Thus Sir Gaheris had great cheer with King Mark, and with Queen La Beale Isoud, the which was glad of Sir Gaheris’ words; for well she wist by his deeds and manners that it was Sir Tristram. And then the king made a feast royal, and to that feast came Sir Uwaine le Fise de Roy Ureine, and some called him Uwaine le Blanchemains. And this Sir Uwaine challenged all the knights of Cornwall. Then was the king wood wroth that he had no knights to answer him. Then Sir Andred, nephew unto King Mark, leapt up and said: I will encounter with Sir Uwaine. Then he yede and armed him and horsed him in the best manner. And there Sir Uwaine met with Sir Andred, and smote him down that he swooned on the earth. Then was King Mark sorry and wroth out of measure that he had no knight to revenge his nephew, Sir Andred.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001993\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001993\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001994\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000001994\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So the king called unto him Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and prayed him for his sake to take upon him to joust with Sir Uwaine.

Then Sir Launcelot smiled and said: Hard it is to take out of the flesh that is bred in the bone; and so made them merry together.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002006\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002006\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002007\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002007\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002008\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002008\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br>\\nHow after that Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan had been long in prison they were delivered.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002009\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002009\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002010\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002010\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Now leave we off this tale, and speak we of Sir Dinas that had within the castle a paramour, and she loved another knight better than him.

That shall not be, said Sir Darras, for God defend when knights come to me for succour that I should suffer them to die within my prison. Therefore, said Sir Darras to the damosel, fetch that knight and his fellows afore me. And then anon Sir Darras saw Sir Tristram brought afore him. He said: Sir knight, me repenteth of thy sickness for thou art called a full noble knight, and so it seemeth by thee; and wit ye well it shall never be said that Sir Darras shall destroy such a noble knight as thou art in prison, howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons whereby I was greatly aggrieved. But now shalt thou go and thy fellows, and your harness and horses have been fair and clean kept, and ye shall go where it liketh you, upon this covenant, that thou, knight, wilt promise me to be good friend to my sons two that be now alive, and also that thou tell me thy name. Sir, said he, as for me my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and in Cornwall was I born, and nephew I am unto King Mark. And as for the death of your sons I might not do withal, for an they had been the next kin that I have I might have done none otherwise. And if I had slain them by treason or treachery I had been worthy to have died. All this I consider, said Sir Darras, that all that ye did was by force of knighthood, and that was the cause I would not put you to death. But sith ye be Sir Tristram, the good knight, I pray you heartily to be my good friend and to my sons. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I promise you by the faith of my body, ever while I live I will do you service, for ye have done to us but as a natural knight ought to do. Then Sir Tristram reposed him there till that he was amended of his sickness; and when he was big and strong they took their leave, and every knight took their horses, and so departed and rode together till they came to a cross way. Now fellows, said Sir Tristram, here will we depart in sundry ways.

And upon the morn when he would have departed the queen said: Wit ye well ye shall not depart lightly, for ye are here as a prisoner. Jesu defend! said Sir Tristram, for I was but late a prisoner. Fair knight, said the queen, ye shall abide with me till that I wit what ye are and from whence ye come. And ever the queen would set Sir Tristram on her own side, and her paramour on the other side. And ever Queen Morgan would behold Sir Tristram, and thereat the knight was jealous, and was in will suddenly to have run upon Sir Tristram with a sword, but he left it for shame. Then the queen said to Sir Tristram: Tell me thy name, and I shall suffer you to depart when ye will. Upon that covenant I tell you my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Ah, said Morgan le Fay, an I had wist that, thou shouldst not have departed so soon as thou shalt. But sithen I have made a promise I will hold it, with that thou wilt promise me to bear upon thee a shield that I shall deliver thee, unto the castle of the Hard Rock, where King Arthur had cried a great tournament, and there I pray you that ye will be, and to do for me as much deeds of arms as ye may do. For at the Castle of Maidens, Sir Tristram, ye did marvellous deeds of arms as ever I heard knight do. Madam, said Sir Tristram, let me see the shield that I shall bear. Then the shield was brought forth, and the field was goldish, with a king and a queen therein painted, and a knight standing above them, [one foot] upon the king’s head, and the other upon the queen’s. Madam, said Sir Tristram, this is a fair shield and a mighty; but what signifieth this king and this queen, and the knight standing upon both their heads? I shall tell you, said Morgan le Fay, it signifieth King Arthur and Queen Guenever, and a knight who holdeth them both in bondage and in servage. Who is that knight? said Sir Tristram. That shall ye not wit as at this time, said the queen. But as the French book saith, Queen Morgan loved Sir Launcelot best, and ever she desired him, and he would never love her nor do nothing at her request, and therefore she held many knights together for to have taken him by strength. And because she deemed that Sir Launcelot loved Queen Guenever paramour, and she him again, therefore Queen Morgan le Fay ordained that shield to put Sir Launcelot to a rebuke, to that intent that King Arthur might understand the love between them. Then Sir Tristram took that shield and promised her to bear it at the tournament at the Castle of the Hard Rock. But Sir Tristram knew not that that shield was ordained against Sir Launcelot, but afterward he knew it.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002024\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002024\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002025\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002025\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002026\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002026\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XLI.<br>\\nHow Sir Tristram took with him the shield, and also how he slew the paramour of Morgan le Fay.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002027\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002027\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002028\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002028\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>So then Sir Tristram took his leave of the queen, and took the shield with him. Then came the knight that held Queen Morgan le Fay, his name was Sir Hemison, and he made him ready to follow Sir Tristram.

Fie on him, coward, said Sir Hemison, for I wist never good knight come out of Cornwall but if it were Sir Tristram de Liones. What an that be he? said she. Nay, nay, said he, he is with La Beale Isoud, and this is but a daffish knight. Alas, my fair friend, ye shall find him the best knight that ever ye met withal, for I know him better than ye do. For your sake, said Sir Hemison, I shall slay him. Ah, fair friend, said the queen, me repenteth that ye will follow that knight, for I fear me sore of your again coming. With this this knight rode his way wood wroth, and he rode after Sir Tristram as fast as he had been chased with knights. When Sir Tristram heard a knight come after him so fast he returned about, and saw a knight coming against him. And when he came nigh to Sir Tristram he cried on high: Sir knight, keep thee from me. Then they rushed together as it had been thunder, and Sir Hemison brised his spear upon Sir Tristram, but his harness was so good that he might not hurt him. And Sir Tristram smote him harder, and bare him through the body, and he fell over his horse’s croup. Then Sir Tristram turned to have done more with his sword, but he saw so much blood go from him that him seemed he was likely to die, and so he departed from him and came to a fair manor to an old knight, and there Sir Tristram lodged.</p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002029\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002029\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002030\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002030\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002031\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002031\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><h3><a></a>CHAPTER XLII.<br>\\nHow Morgan le Fay buried her paramour, and how Sir Tristram praised Sir Launcelot and his kin.</h3></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002032\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002032\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002033\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000002033\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-467e3a twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-362423 twpub-22bf6e83cee936d3-6b4cd0\\\"><div class=\\\"chapter\\\"><p>Now leave to speak of Sir Tristram, and speak we of the knight that was wounded to the death.

Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part\\n<br>of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm\\n<br>concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,\\n<br>and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive\\n<br>specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this\\n<br>eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook\\n<br>for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,\\n<br>performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given\\n<br>away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks\\n<br>not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the\\n<br>trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.\\n<br>\\n<br>START: FULL LICENSE\\n<br>\\n<br>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE\\n<br>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK\\n<br>\\n<br>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free\\n<br>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work\\n<br>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &quot;Project\\n<br>Gutenberg&quot;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at\\n<br>www.gutenberg.org/license.\\n<br>\\n<br>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n<br>\\n<br>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to\\n<br>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property\\n<br>(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all\\n<br>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or\\n<br>destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your\\n<br>possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound\\n<br>by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the\\n<br>person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph\\n<br>1.E.8.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.B. &quot;Project Gutenberg&quot; is a registered trademark. It may only be\\n<br>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who\\n<br>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few\\n<br>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n<br>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See\\n<br>paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this\\n<br>agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&quot;the\\n<br>Foundation&quot; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection\\n<br>of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual\\n<br>works in the collection are in the public domain in the United\\n<br>States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the\\n<br>United States and you are located in the United States, we do not\\n<br>claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,\\n<br>displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as\\n<br>all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope\\n<br>that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting\\n<br>free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily\\n<br>comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the\\n<br>same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when\\n<br>you share it without charge with others.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\\n<br>what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are\\n<br>in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,\\n<br>check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this\\n<br>agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,\\n<br>distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any\\n<br>other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no\\n<br>representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any\\n<br>country outside the United States.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other\\n<br>immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear\\n<br>prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work\\n<br>on which the phrase &quot;Project Gutenberg&quot; appears, or with which the\\n<br>phrase &quot;Project Gutenberg&quot; is associated) is accessed, displayed,\\n<br>performed, viewed, copied or distributed:\\n<br>\\n<br>  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\\n<br>  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no\\n<br>  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it\\n<br>  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this\\n<br>  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the\\n<br>  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you\\n<br>  are located before using this ebook.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is\\n<br>derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not\\n<br>contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the\\n<br>copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in\\n<br>the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are\\n<br>redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &quot;Project\\n<br>Gutenberg&quot; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply\\n<br>either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or\\n<br>obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted\\n<br>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution\\n<br>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any\\n<br>additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms\\n<br>will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works\\n<br>posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the\\n<br>beginning of this work.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this\\n<br>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this\\n<br>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without\\n<br>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with\\n<br>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm License.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,\\n<br>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including\\n<br>any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access\\n<br>to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format\\n<br>other than &quot;Plain Vanilla ASCII&quot; or other format used in the official\\n<br>version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site\\n<br>(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense\\n<br>to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means\\n<br>of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &quot;Plain\\n<br>Vanilla ASCII&quot; or other form. Any alternate format must include the\\n<br>full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,\\n<br>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works\\n<br>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing\\n<br>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n<br>provided that\\n<br>\\n<br>* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from\\n<br>  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method\\n<br>  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed\\n<br>  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has\\n<br>  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project\\n<br>  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid\\n<br>  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are\\n<br>  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty\\n<br>  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project\\n<br>  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in\\n<br>  Section 4, &quot;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg\\n<br>  Literary Archive Foundation.&quot;\\n<br>\\n<br>* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies\\n<br>  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\\n<br>  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all\\n<br>  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue\\n<br>  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>  works.\\n<br>\\n<br>* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of\\n<br>  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the\\n<br>  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of\\n<br>  receipt of the work.\\n<br>\\n<br>* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free\\n<br>  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than\\n<br>are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing\\n<br>from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The\\n<br>Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\\n<br>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\\n<br>works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may\\n<br>contain &quot;Defects,&quot; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate\\n<br>or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other\\n<br>intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or\\n<br>other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or\\n<br>cannot be read by your equipment.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &quot;Right\\n<br>of Replacement or Refund&quot; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\n<br>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\n<br>fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\\n<br>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\\n<br>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\\n<br>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\\n<br>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\\n<br>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\\n<br>DAMAGE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\\n<br>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\\n<br>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\\n<br>written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you\\n<br>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium\\n<br>with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you\\n<br>with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in\\n<br>lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person\\n<br>or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second\\n<br>opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If\\n<br>the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing\\n<br>without further opportunities to fix the problem.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\\n<br>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO\\n<br>OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT\\n<br>LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\\n<br>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of\\n<br>damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement\\n<br>violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the\\n<br>agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or\\n<br>limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or\\n<br>unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the\\n<br>remaining provisions.\\n<br>\\n<br>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\n<br>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\n<br>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in\\n<br>accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\\n<br>production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\\n<br>including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\\n<br>the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\\n<br>or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or\\n<br>additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any\\n<br>Defect you cause.\\n<br>\\n<br>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\n<br>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\n<br>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\n<br>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\n<br>from people in all walks of life.\\n<br>\\n<br>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\n<br>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\n<br>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\n<br>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\n<br>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\n<br>generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\n<br>Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\n<br>Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\n<br>www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n<br>\\n<br>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n<br>501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\n<br>state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\n<br>Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\\n<br>number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\n<br>Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\n<br>U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\\n<br>\\n<br>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\n<br>mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\n<br>volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\n<br>locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\n<br>Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\n<br>Literary Archive Foundation\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\n<br>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\n<br>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\n<br>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\n<br>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n<br>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\n<br>status with the IRS.\\n<br>\\n<br>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\n<br>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\n<br>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\n<br>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\n<br>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\n<br>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n<br>\\n<br>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\n<br>Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\n<br>freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\n<br>distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\n<br>volunteer support.\\n<br>\\n<br>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\n<br>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\n<br>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\n<br>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\n<br>edition.\\n<br>\\n<br>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\n<br>facility: www.gutenberg.org\\n<br>\\n<br>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\n<br>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\n<br>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\n<br>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<br></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/toc/np-1\": {\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/toc/np-1\",\n            \"caption\": \"Le Morte D’Arthur\",\n            \"tags\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/toc\",\n            \"target\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000002\",\n            \"list\": \"\",\n            \"role\": \"toc\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/toc/np-2\": {\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/toc/np-2\",\n            \"caption\": \"King Arthur and of his Noble Knights of the Round Table\",\n            \"tags\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/toc\",\n            \"target\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/text/000000003\",\n            \"list\": \"\",\n            \"role\": \"toc\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/toc/np-3\": {\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/22bf6e83cee936d3/toc/np-3\",\n            \"caption\": \"IN TWO VOLS.—VOL.
